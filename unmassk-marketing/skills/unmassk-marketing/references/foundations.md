# Marketing Foundations Reference

Complete reference for product context, mental models, psychology, and marketing ideas. Use this before any marketing task to ground strategy in positioning, psychology, and proven tactics.

---

## Product Marketing Context

### Pre-Check (Universal — run before every marketing task)

Check if `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists (or `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` for legacy setups). If it exists, read it before applying any models or generating recommendations. Use that context to tailor all output to the specific product and audience.

### Purpose

Create and maintain `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` — a single document capturing all foundational positioning and messaging. Every other marketing task references this file to avoid repeating information.

### Workflow

1. Check if `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` exists. Also check `.claude/product-marketing-context.md` for legacy setups.
2. If it exists: read it, summarize what is captured, ask which sections to update.
3. If it does not exist, offer two paths:
   - **Auto-draft from codebase** (recommended): scan README, landing pages, marketing copy, package.json, meta descriptions. Draft a V1 and iterate with the user.
   - **Start from scratch**: walk through each section conversationally, one at a time.
4. Push for verbatim customer language — exact phrases are more valuable than polished descriptions.

### The 12-Section Template

#### 1. Product Overview
- One-line description
- What it does (2-3 sentences)
- Product category (what "shelf" customers search on)
- Product type (SaaS, marketplace, e-commerce, service, etc.)
- Business model and pricing

#### 2. Target Audience
- Target company type (industry, size, stage)
- Target decision-makers (roles, departments)
- Primary use case (the main problem solved)
- Jobs to be done (2-3 things customers "hire" the product for)
- Specific use cases or scenarios

#### 3. Personas (B2B only)
Capture for each stakeholder (User, Champion, Decision Maker, Financial Buyer, Technical Influencer):
- What each cares about
- Their specific challenge
- The value promised to them

#### 4. Problems and Pain Points
- Core challenge before finding the product
- Why current solutions fall short
- Cost (time, money, missed opportunities)
- Emotional tension (stress, fear, doubt)

#### 5. Competitive Landscape
- **Direct competitors**: same solution, same problem
- **Secondary competitors**: different solution, same problem
- **Indirect competitors**: conflicting approach entirely
- How each falls short for the target customer

#### 6. Differentiation
- Key differentiators (capabilities alternatives lack)
- How the product solves it differently
- Why that approach is better (concrete benefits)
- Why customers choose this product over alternatives

#### 7. Objections and Anti-Personas
- Top 3 objections heard in sales and how to address each
- Who is NOT a good fit (anti-persona)

#### 8. Switching Dynamics (JTBD Four Forces)
- **Push**: frustrations driving them away from current solution
- **Pull**: what attracts them to this product
- **Habit**: what keeps them stuck with current approach
- **Anxiety**: what worries them about switching

#### 9. Customer Language
- How customers describe the problem (verbatim quotes)
- How they describe the solution (verbatim quotes)
- Words and phrases to use
- Words and phrases to avoid
- Glossary of product-specific terms

#### 10. Brand Voice
- Tone (professional, casual, playful, etc.)
- Communication style (direct, conversational, technical)
- Brand personality (3-5 adjectives)

#### 11. Proof Points
- Key metrics or results to cite
- Notable customers and logos
- Testimonial snippets
- Main value themes with supporting evidence

#### 12. Goals
- Primary business goal
- Key conversion action (what visitors should do)
- Current metrics (if known)

### Tips for Gathering Context
- Ask "What is the number one frustration that brings them to the product?" not generic questions
- Capture exact words from real customers
- Ask for examples to unlock better answers
- Validate and summarize each section before moving on
- Skip sections that do not apply (e.g., Personas for B2C)

### Output Template

After gathering information, create `.agents/product-marketing-context.md` with this structure:

```markdown

## Mental Models and Psychology

### Agent Workflow

1. Check for product marketing context (see Pre-Check above).
2. Identify which models apply to the user's specific situation.
3. Explain the psychology behind each relevant model.
4. Provide specific marketing applications for the product and audience.
5. Suggest how to implement ethically.

When the user describes a challenge, ask:
- What specific behavior are you trying to influence?
- What does your customer believe before encountering your marketing?
- Where in the journey (awareness → consideration → decision) is this?
- What is currently preventing the desired action?
- Have you tested this with real customers?

### Foundational Thinking Models (14 Models)

Use these to sharpen strategy and solve the right problems.

| Model | Core Principle | Marketing Application |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| First Principles | Break problems to basic truths, build from there | Do not copy competitors blindly. Ask "why" five times to find root causes. |
| Jobs to Be Done | People hire products for outcomes, not features | Frame around the job accomplished. "A drill buyer wants a hole." |
| Circle of Competence | Stay where genuine expertise exists | Double down on channels with real competitive advantage. |
| Inversion | Ask "What guarantees failure?" then avoid those things | List everything that kills a campaign (confusing messaging, wrong audience, slow pages), then prevent each. |
| Occam's Razor | Simplest explanation is usually correct | Check the obvious first (broken form, page speed) before assuming complex attribution issues. |
| Pareto Principle (80/20) | 80% of results come from 20% of efforts | Find the 20% of channels, customers, or content driving 80% of results. Cut the rest. |
| Local vs. Global Optima | Best nearby is not best overall | Optimizing email subject lines (local) is pointless if email is the wrong channel (global). Zoom out first. |
| Theory of Constraints | Every system has one bottleneck | If the funnel converts well but traffic is low, fix traffic first. |
| Opportunity Cost | Every choice costs what you give up | Time on a low-ROI channel is time not spent on high-ROI activities. |
| Diminishing Returns | Additional investment yields smaller gains after a point | The 10th blog post will not have the same impact as the first. Know when to diversify. |
| Second-Order Thinking | Consider effects of effects | A flash sale boosts revenue (first order) but may train customers to wait for discounts (second order). |
| Map vs. Territory | Models represent reality but are not reality | The customer persona is useful but real customers are more complex. Stay in touch with actual users. |
| Probabilistic Thinking | Think in probabilities, not certainties | Spread risk. Plan for scenarios where the primary strategy underperforms. |
| Barbell Strategy | Combine extreme safety with small high-risk bets | 80% budget on proven channels, 20% on experimental bets. Avoid the mediocre middle. |

### Buyer Psychology Models (22 Models)

These explain how customers think, decide, and behave.

**Fundamental Attribution Error** — People attribute behavior to character, not circumstances. When customers do not convert, examine the process before blaming them.

**Mere Exposure Effect** — Familiarity breeds liking. Consistent brand presence across channels builds preference over time.

**Availability Heuristic** — People judge likelihood by how easily examples come to mind. Case studies and testimonials make success feel achievable.

**Confirmation Bias** — People seek information confirming existing beliefs. Align messaging with what the audience already believes. Fighting beliefs head-on rarely works.

**The Lindy Effect** — The longer something has survived, the longer it will likely continue. Proven marketing principles (clear value props, social proof) outlast trendy tactics.

**Mimetic Desire** — People want things because others want them. Waitlists, exclusivity, and social proof trigger mimetic desire.

**Sunk Cost Fallacy** — People continue investing because of past investment. Kill underperforming campaigns regardless of past spend.

**Endowment Effect** — People value things more once they own them. Free trials and freemium models make users reluctant to give up the product.

**IKEA Effect** — People value things more when they built them. Let customers customize, configure, or build. Their investment increases commitment.

**Zero-Price Effect** — "Free" is psychologically different from any price. Free tiers, trials, and shipping have disproportionate appeal. The jump from $1 to $0 is bigger than $2 to $1.

**Hyperbolic Discounting / Present Bias** — People strongly prefer immediate rewards. Emphasize "Start saving time today" over "You will see ROI in 6 months."

**Status-Quo Bias** — People prefer the current state. Reduce friction to switch. Make the transition feel safe: "Import your data in one click."

**Default Effect** — People accept pre-selected options. Pre-select the recommended plan. Opt-out beats opt-in (ethically applied).

**Paradox of Choice** — Too many options paralyze. Three pricing tiers beat seven. Recommend a single "best for most" option.

**Goal-Gradient Effect** — People accelerate as they approach a goal. Show progress bars, completion percentages, and "almost there" messaging.

**Peak-End Rule** — People judge experiences by the best/worst moment and the ending. Design memorable peaks (surprise upgrades) and strong endings (thank-you pages, follow-ups).

**Zeigarnik Effect** — Unfinished tasks occupy the mind. "You are 80% done" creates pull to finish. Incomplete profiles and abandoned carts leverage this.

**Pratfall Effect** — Competent entities become more likable with a small flaw. Admitting "We are not the cheapest, but..." increases trust and differentiation.

**Curse of Knowledge** — Experts cannot imagine not knowing. Test copy with people unfamiliar with the space.

**Mental Accounting** — People treat money differently by category. "$3/day" feels different from "$90/month" even though identical.

**Regret Aversion** — People avoid actions that might cause regret. Money-back guarantees, free trials, and "no commitment" messaging reduce fear.

**Bandwagon Effect / Social Proof** — People follow what others do. Show customer counts, testimonials, logos, reviews, and "trending" indicators.

### Influence and Persuasion Models (13 Models)

Use these to ethically influence customer decisions.

**Reciprocity Principle** — Give first (free content, tools, generous free tiers). People feel obligated to return favors.

**Commitment and Consistency** — Get small commitments first (email signup, free trial). People who take one step are more likely to take the next.

**Authority Bias** — People defer to experts. Feature expert endorsements, certifications, "featured in" logos, and thought leadership.

**Liking / Similarity Bias** — People say yes to those they like. Use relatable spokespeople and community language. "Built by marketers for marketers."

**Unity Principle** — Shared identity drives influence. Position the brand as part of the customer's tribe with insider language and shared values.

**Scarcity / Urgency** — Limited availability increases perceived value. Limited-time offers and exclusive access create urgency. Only use when genuine.

**Foot-in-the-Door** — Small request first, then escalate. Free trial, then paid plan, then annual plan, then enterprise.

**Door-in-the-Face** — Start with an unreasonably large ask, then retreat. Show enterprise pricing first, then reveal the affordable starter plan.

**Loss Aversion / Prospect Theory** — Losses hurt twice as much as gains feel good. Frame in terms of what they lose by not acting.

**Anchoring Effect** — The first number seen heavily influences judgment. Show the higher price first to anchor expectations.

**Decoy Effect** — A third inferior option makes the preferred option look better. A "decoy" pricing tier makes the target tier the obvious choice.

**Framing Effect** — Same facts, different perception. "90% success rate" versus "10% failure rate" feel different. Frame positively.

**Contrast Effect** — Things seem different depending on comparison. Show the "before" state clearly to make the "after" vivid.

### Pricing Psychology (5 Models)

**Charm Pricing / Left-Digit Effect** — $99 feels much cheaper than $100. Use .99 endings for value-focused products.

**Rounded-Price (Fluency) Effect** — Round numbers feel premium. Use $500/month for premium products, $497/month for value products.

**Rule of 100** — Under $100: percentage discounts seem larger ("20% off"). Over $100: absolute discounts seem larger ("$50 off").

**Price Relativity / Good-Better-Best** — Three tiers where the middle is the target. The expensive tier makes it look reasonable; the cheap tier anchors.

**Mental Accounting (Pricing)** — "$1/day" feels cheaper than "$30/month." "Less than your morning coffee" reframes the expense.

### Design and Delivery Models (10 Models)

**Hick's Law** — More choices equal slower decisions equal more abandonment. One clear CTA beats three.

**AIDA Funnel** — Attention, Interest, Desire, Action. Structure pages and campaigns to move through each stage.

**Rule of 7** — Prospects need roughly 7 touchpoints before converting. Build multi-touch campaigns. Retargeting, email sequences, and consistent presence compound.

**Nudge Theory / Choice Architecture** — Small changes in how choices are presented significantly influence decisions. Default selections, strategic ordering, friction reduction.

**BJ Fogg Behavior Model** — Behavior = Motivation x Ability x Prompt. All three must be present. Design for all three.

**EAST Framework** — Make desired behaviors Easy, Attractive, Social, Timely.

**COM-B Model** — Behavior requires Capability, Opportunity, Motivation. Can they do it? Is the path clear? Do they want to?

**Activation Energy** — High starting friction prevents action. Pre-fill forms, offer templates, show quick wins. Make the first step trivially easy.

**North Star Metric** — One metric capturing the core value delivered. Identify it and align all efforts toward it.

**The Cobra Effect** — When incentives backfire. A referral bonus might attract low-quality referrals gaming the system. Test incentive structures.

### Growth and Scaling Models (8 Models)

**Feedback Loops** — Output becomes input. More users lead to more content, better SEO, and more users. Identify and strengthen positive loops.

**Compounding** — Small consistent gains accumulate exponentially. Content, SEO, and brand building compound over time.

**Network Effects** — Product becomes more valuable with more users. Design features that improve with adoption: shared workspaces, integrations, communities.

**Flywheel Effect** — Content leads to traffic, leads, customers, case studies, and more content. Each element powers the next.

**Switching Costs** — High switching costs create retention. Increase ethically: integrations, data accumulation, workflow customization, team adoption.

**Exploration vs. Exploitation** — Balance trying new things with optimizing what works. Do not abandon working channels for shiny new ones.

**Critical Mass / Tipping Point** — Focus resources on reaching critical mass in one segment before expanding. Depth before breadth.

**Survivorship Bias** — The viral hit you copy had 99 failures you never saw. Study failed campaigns, not just successful ones.
