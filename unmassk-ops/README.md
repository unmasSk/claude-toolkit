# unmassk-ops

**DevOps toolkit covering infrastructure, containers, CI/CD, observability, scripting, deployments, and error tracking.**

7 skills spanning the full DevOps lifecycle: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Terragrunt, Ansible), containers (Docker, Helm, Kubernetes), CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure Pipelines, Jenkins), observability (PromQL, LogQL, Loki, Fluent Bit), scripting (Bash, Makefile), deployments (Vercel, Railway), and error tracking (Sentry, OpenTelemetry).

Based on [cc-devops-skills](https://github.com/akin-ozer/cc-devops-skills) by akin-ozer (Apache-2.0).

## Quick start

Run `/plugin` in Claude Code and install `unmassk-ops` from the marketplace.

## Dependencies

Requires the **unmassk-crew** plugin for agent execution. Install it from the marketplace before using unmassk-ops.

## Scripts

All scripts use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` paths and run with `set -euo pipefail`. Scripts call real tools (terraform, tflint, checkov, ansible-lint, hadolint, kubeconform, actionlint, act, shellcheck, promtool) with graceful fallback when tools are missing.

## BM25 skill discovery

All 7 skills include `catalog.skillcat` files for BM25-indexed discovery by agents in unmassk-crew. ops-deploy had a pre-existing skillcat; the remaining 6 were added in 1.2.0.
