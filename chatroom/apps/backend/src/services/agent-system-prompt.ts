 *
 * System prompt construction for agent invocations.
 * Extracted from agent-prompt.ts to keep that module under 300 lines.
 *
 * Exports:
 *   - RESPAWN_DELIMITER_BEGIN / RESPAWN_DELIMITER_END — box-drawing delimiters
 *   - buildSystemPrompt — system prompt with identity, chatroom rules, and security rules
 *   - buildIdentityBlock — identity + optional respawn notice lines
 *   - buildChatroomRules — @mention, silence, courtesy, anti-spam rule lines
 *   - buildSecurityRules — security denylist + optional git diff stat lines
