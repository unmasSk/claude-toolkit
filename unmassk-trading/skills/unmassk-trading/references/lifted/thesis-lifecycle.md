# Thesis Lifecycle

## Status States

| Status | Description | Typical Trigger |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| `IDEA` | Screened candidate, not yet validated for entry | Ingest from screener output |
| `ENTRY_READY` | Validated, entry conditions defined, waiting for price | Manual review / deep-dive analysis |
| `ACTIVE` | Position opened (actual_price and actual_date filled); `shares_remaining == shares` | Entry execution confirmed |
| `PARTIALLY_CLOSED` | Part of the position trimmed; `0 < shares_remaining < shares` | `trim()` sold some shares |
| `CLOSED` | Position fully exited, outcome recorded; `shares_remaining == 0` | Exit execution confirmed |
| `INVALIDATED` | Thesis killed before or during holding | Kill criteria triggered |

## Valid Transitions

```
IDEA ─► ENTRY_READY ─► ACTIVE ─► PARTIALLY_CLOSED ─► CLOSED
  │          │            │            │ ▲   │
  │          │            │            │ └───┘ (further trims)
  └──────────┴────────────┴────────────┴───────────► INVALIDATED
```

`ACTIVE → PARTIALLY_CLOSED → … → CLOSED` is driven by `trim()` only;
`trim()` that sells the entire remainder goes straight to `CLOSED`. `close()`
accepts `ACTIVE` **or** `PARTIALLY_CLOSED`.

### Partial close & cumulative P&L

`position.shares` is the original opened quantity (immutable);
`position.shares_remaining` is the currently-open quantity. Each `trim()` and
the final close append a `status_history` ledger entry carrying
`shares_sold` / `price` / `proceeds` / `realized_pnl`.
`outcome.pnl_dollars = Σ realized_pnl`;
`outcome.pnl_pct = pnl_dollars / (entry_price × original_shares) × 100`.
With no trims this is identical to the legacy single-leg result. Legacy
ACTIVE/CLOSED theses missing `shares_remaining` validate fine and are treated
as fully open at runtime; `PARTIALLY_CLOSED` (a post-PR-80B status) always
requires `position.shares` + `position.shares_remaining`.

### Forward-Only Rule

Transitions must move forward in the lifecycle. Reverse transitions are not allowed:

- `ACTIVE → IDEA` — **blocked** (ValueError)
- `CLOSED → ACTIVE` — **blocked** (ValueError)
- `INVALIDATED → *` — **blocked** (terminal state)

### Any → INVALIDATED

Any non-terminal status can transition to `INVALIDATED`:
- `IDEA → INVALIDATED` (screener output invalidated before review)
- `ENTRY_READY → INVALIDATED` (kill criteria triggered before entry)
- `ACTIVE → INVALIDATED` (kill criteria triggered during holding)

## Status-Dependent Operations

| Operation | Required Status | Effect |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| `register()` | — | Creates thesis with `IDEA` status (idempotent via fingerprint) |
| `transition()` | Any non-terminal (IDEA → ENTRY_READY only) | Advances status, appends to `status_history` |
| `open_position()` | `ENTRY_READY` | Sets entry data + `shares_remaining`, transitions to `ACTIVE` (only path to ACTIVE) |
| `attach_position()` | `IDEA` / `ENTRY_READY` / `ACTIVE` | Attaches position sizing data (sets `shares` + `shares_remaining == shares`); rejected on PARTIALLY_CLOSED / CLOSED / INVALIDATED (would corrupt the trim ledger) |
| `trim()` | `ACTIVE` / `PARTIALLY_CLOSED` | Sells part; appends a ledger entry, decrements `shares_remaining`; → `PARTIALLY_CLOSED` (or `CLOSED` if remainder hits 0) |
| `link_report()` | Any | Adds linked report reference |
| `close()` | `ACTIVE` / `PARTIALLY_CLOSED` | Sets `CLOSED`, computes cumulative `outcome.pnl_*` and `holding_days` |
| `terminate()` | Any non-terminal | Transitions to `CLOSED` (delegates to close) or `INVALIDATED` with optional exit data |
| `mark_reviewed()` | Any non-terminal | Updates review dates and status based on review_date |
| `rebuild_index()` | — | Recreates `_index.json` from YAML files |
| `validate_state()` | — | Checks file ⇔ index consistency + schema validation |

**Important**:
- `transition()` only allows `IDEA → ENTRY_READY`; `ACTIVE` and
  `PARTIALLY_CLOSED` are blocked (use `open_position()` / `trim()`), as are
  all terminal statuses.
- Use `open_position()` to reach `ACTIVE` (requires `actual_price` and `actual_date`).
- Use `trim()` to reach `PARTIALLY_CLOSED` (requires `shares_sold`, `price`, `date`).
- Use `close()` (from `ACTIVE` or `PARTIALLY_CLOSED`), `trim()` selling the
  whole remainder, or `terminate(terminal_status="CLOSED")` to reach `CLOSED`.
- Use `terminate(terminal_status="INVALIDATED")` to reach `INVALIDATED`
  (cumulative P&L when price+date supplied; otherwise the legacy no-P&L path).

## CLI Access

Every lifecycle operation is also a `thesis_store.py` subcommand:
`transition`, `open-position`, `attach-position`, `close`, `terminate`
(alongside `list` / `get` / `review-due` / `rebuild-index` / `doctor` /
`mark-reviewed`). No Python required to walk a thesis through its lifecycle.

### Backdating an existing position (`--event-date`)

`transition`, `open-position`, `close`, and `terminate` accept `--event-date`
(sets that transition's `status_history.at`). `open-position` also takes
`--actual-date` (→ `entry.actual_date`); `close`/`terminate` take
`--actual-date` (→ `exit.actual_date`). A plain `YYYY-MM-DD` is widened to
midnight UTC; a full ISO timestamp passes through.

`transition --event-date` exists specifically so an already-open broker
position recorded via the `manual` adapter keeps a **chronological** history:
the manual adapter backdates the `IDEA` stamp to `entry_date`, then
`transition --event-date <entry_date>` and `open-position --event-date
<entry_date>` keep `ENTRY_READY` and `ACTIVE` at the same date. Without
`transition --event-date`, `ENTRY_READY` would be stamped "now" while a
backdated `open-position --event-date` puts `ACTIVE` in the past — so `ACTIVE`
lands before `ENTRY_READY`, failing the `status_history` monotonicity check on
save.

## Monitoring Cycle

1. On `register()`: `next_review_date` = `created_at + review_interval_days`
2. On review: `last_review_date` updated, `next_review_date` advanced
3. `list_review_due(as_of)` returns theses where `next_review_date <= as_of`
4. Review status: `OK` → `WARN` → `REVIEW` (escalation ladder)
