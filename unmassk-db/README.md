# unmassk-db

**Database toolkit covering PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, migrations, vector/RAG, and schema design.**

7 skills for database operations: PostgreSQL deep dive (schema design, indexing, TimescaleDB, pgvector, PostGIS, MVCC), MySQL (schema, queries, replication, InnoDB), MongoDB (CRUD, aggregation, sharding, Atlas), Redis (data structures, caching, vector search, streams, security), zero-downtime migrations (expand-contract, CDC, rollback), vector/RAG pipelines (pgvector, chunking, embeddings, evaluation), and database schema design (normalization, index strategy, RLS).

## Quick start

Run `/plugin` in Claude Code and install `unmassk-db` from the marketplace.

## Dependencies

Requires the **unmassk-crew** plugin for agent execution. Install it from the marketplace before using unmassk-db.

## Scripts

Migration and schema design scripts are Python CLI tools. They generate SQL output that requires human review before execution. All SQL identifiers are validated against injection.

## Audited by

- **Cerberus** — code review + security audit of all 6 scripts (2 Critical + 7 Warning fixed)
- **Cerberus** — MongoDB content verified against official documentation via Context7
- **Bilbo** — source repo exploration and quality assessment
