  Use when the user asks to "set up pgvector", "RAG pipeline",
  "embedding strategy", "chunking strategy", "evaluate retrieval quality",
  or mentions any of: pgvector, RAG, retrieval augmented generation,
  chunking, IVF, halfvec, embedding model, reranking, cross-encoder,
  recall@K, MRR, NDCG, chunking strategy, embedding benchmark.
  For Redis vector search use db-redis instead. For general
  "semantic search" or "vector search" without specifying a backend,
  this skill covers the pgvector path and RAG pipeline design.
  Use this for implementing semantic search with pgvector (HNSW,
  IVF-PQ, halfvec), designing RAG pipelines with optimal chunking
  strategies, selecting embedding models, building hybrid search
  (vector + BM25), and evaluating retrieval quality with standard
  metrics. 5 reference files from pg-aiguide by Timescale (MIT)

## Decision Flow

1. **Storage:** Use `halfvec(N)` + HNSW (`m=16, ef_construction=64`) for most workloads.
2. **Chunking:** Start with semantic (heading-aware) for structured docs, sentence-based for general text.
3. **Embedding model:** `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5` for self-hosted quality; `text-embedding-3-large` for managed.
4. **Retrieval:** Dense search with `ef_search=100` as baseline. Add BM25 hybrid if keyword precision matters.
5. **Evaluate:** Measure NDCG@10 and MRR@10 on a representative query set before going to production.

## Key Rules

- Always use the same embedding model for indexing and querying.
- Cast query vectors explicitly: `$1::halfvec(N)` — implicit casts fail in prepared statements.
- Build HNSW indexes after bulk loading initial data for best build performance.
- For filtered queries with selective filters, enable `SET hnsw.iterative_scan = relaxed_order`.

## Scope Boundaries

- **db-postgres**: PostgreSQL-specific operations beyond pgvector (MVCC, VACUUM, partitioning)
- **db-schema-design**: Relational schema design for the tables storing embeddings
- **db-mysql**: MySQL — pgvector is PostgreSQL-only
