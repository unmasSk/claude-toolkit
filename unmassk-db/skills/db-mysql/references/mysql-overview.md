# MySQL Overview

Use this skill to make safe, measurable MySQL/InnoDB changes.

## Workflow

1. Define workload and constraints: read/write mix, latency target, data volume, MySQL version.
2. Read only the relevant reference files linked in the SKILL.md routing table.
3. Propose the smallest change that solves the problem, including trade-offs.
4. Validate with evidence (`EXPLAIN`, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`, lock/connection metrics, and production-safe rollout steps).
5. For production changes, include rollback and post-deploy verification.

## Schema Design Rules

- Prefer narrow, monotonic PKs (`BIGINT UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT`) for write-heavy OLTP tables.
- Avoid random UUID values as clustered PKs. If external IDs are required, keep UUID in a secondary unique column.
- Always `utf8mb4` / `utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci`. Prefer `NOT NULL`, `DATETIME` over `TIMESTAMP`.
- Lookup tables over `ENUM`. Normalize to 3NF; denormalize only for measured hot paths.

## Indexing Rules

- Composite order: equality first, then range/sort (leftmost prefix rule).
- Range predicates stop index usage for subsequent columns.
- Secondary indexes include PK implicitly. Use prefix indexes for long strings.
- Audit via `performance_schema` — drop indexes with `COUNT_READ = 0`.

## Partitioning Rules

- Partition time-series (>50M rows) or large tables (>100M rows). Plan early — retrofit = full rebuild.
- Include partition column in every unique/PK. Always add a `MAXVALUE` catch-all.

## Query Optimization Rules

- Check `EXPLAIN` — red flags: `type: ALL`, `Using filesort`, `Using temporary`.
- Cursor pagination, not `OFFSET`. Avoid functions on indexed columns in `WHERE`.
- Batch inserts (500–5000 rows). `UNION ALL` over `UNION` when dedup unnecessary.

## Transactions and Locking Rules

- Default: `REPEATABLE READ` (gap locks). Use `READ COMMITTED` for high contention.
- Consistent row access order prevents deadlocks. Retry error 1213 with backoff.
- Do I/O outside transactions. Use `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` sparingly.

## Operations Rules

- Use online DDL (`ALGORITHM=INSTANT` or `ALGORITHM=INPLACE`) when possible; test on replicas first.
- Tune connection pooling — avoid `max_connections` exhaustion under load.
- Monitor replication lag; avoid stale reads from replicas during writes.

## Guardrails

- Prefer measured evidence over blanket rules of thumb.
- Note MySQL-version-specific behavior when giving advice.
- Ask for explicit human approval before destructive data operations (drops/deletes/truncates).
