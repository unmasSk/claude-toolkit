  Use when the user asks to "design database schema", "normalize schema",
  "database selection", "ERD diagram", "seed data", "schema analysis",
  "which database should I use",
  or mentions any of: schema design, normalization, 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF,
  denormalization, ERD, entity relationship, database selection,
  SQL vs NoSQL, seed data, fixtures.
  Does NOT cover database-specific index tuning (use db-postgres or db-mysql)
  or database-specific RLS implementation (use db-postgres).
  Use this for designing database schemas from requirements with
  normalization analysis (1NF through BCNF), selecting the right
  database technology for the use case, creating index strategies,
  implementing row-level security policies, generating ERD diagrams,
  and analyzing existing schemas for optimization opportunities.
  Includes 2 Python scripts for schema analysis and index optimization.

| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/db-schema-design/scripts/schema_analyzer.py` | Analyzes DDL for normalization compliance, constraint validation, naming conventions, produces ERD |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/db-schema-design/scripts/index_optimizer.py` | Analyzes schema + query patterns, detects missing/redundant indexes, outputs CREATE INDEX statements |

## Design Process

1. **Requirements → Entities:** Extract entities and relationships from requirements.
2. **Normalize to 3NF:** Eliminate partial and transitive dependencies.
3. **Add cross-cutting concerns:** Multi-tenancy (org_id), soft deletes (deleted_at), audit trail (created_at, updated_at, created_by).
4. **Index strategy:** Index every FK, add composite indexes for common query patterns, partial indexes for filtered queries.
5. **RLS policies:** Implement row-level security at the database layer for multi-tenant apps.
6. **Validate with schema_analyzer.py** if DDL is available.

## Key Rules

- Every FK column must have an index.
- Use `deleted_at TIMESTAMPTZ` for soft deletes — add `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` partial indexes.
- Never use email, slug, or mutable values as PKs — use UUID/CUID/BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT.
- Adding `NOT NULL` without a default to an existing table requires migration planning.
- Test RLS policies with a non-superuser role before deploying.
- Denormalize only for measured hot paths — start normalized, optimize later.

## Scope Boundaries

- **db-mysql**: MySQL-specific DDL, InnoDB mechanics, EXPLAIN analysis
- **db-postgres**: PostgreSQL-specific features (MVCC, VACUUM, partitioning, pgvector)
- **db-migrations**: Zero-downtime migration patterns for changing existing schemas
- **db-vector-rag**: Vector/embedding schema considerations
