## Category Deep Dive

### Traditional SQL

**PostgreSQL**
- Best for: complex queries, JSON data, extensions (pgvector, PostGIS, TimescaleDB), mixed workloads.
- Strengths: feature-rich, ACID, extensible, strong community.
- Scale: vertical + read replicas + partitioning.
- Choose when: need SQL features, complex queries, moderate scale, or any PostgreSQL extension.

**MySQL**
- Best for: web applications, read-heavy workloads, simple schemas.
- Strengths: performance, replication, large ecosystem.
- Scale: read replicas + sharding.
- Choose when: simple schema, performance priority, large team familiarity.

**SQL Server**
- Best for: Microsoft ecosystem, enterprise BI, .NET applications.
- Choose when: Microsoft stack, enterprise requirements, SSRS/SSAS integration.

### Distributed SQL (NewSQL)

**CockroachDB:** Global ACID + horizontal scaling. Multi-region apps, financial services.
**TiDB:** MySQL-compatible + HTAP. Existing MySQL expertise + scale.
**Spanner:** Google Cloud managed distributed SQL.

### NoSQL — Document Stores

**MongoDB:** Flexible schema, rapid development, document-centric data. Catalog, profiles, CMS.
**CouchDB:** Offline-first, bi-directional sync, HTTP API.

### Key-Value Stores

**Redis:** In-memory, <1ms latency, rich data structures. Caching, sessions, leaderboards, pub/sub.
**DynamoDB:** Serverless, AWS-native, predictable performance. Gaming, IoT, mobile backends.
**Cassandra:** Write-heavy, linear scalability, no single point of failure. Time-series, messaging, activity feeds.

### Graph Databases

**Neo4j:** Mature ecosystem, Cypher query language, graph algorithms. Social networks, fraud detection, recommendation engines.

### Time-Series

**InfluxDB:** Purpose-built, high write volume. IoT sensors, monitoring, DevOps metrics.
**TimescaleDB:** PostgreSQL extension, SQL compatibility. Financial data, IoT with complex queries.

### Search Engines

**Elasticsearch:** Full-text search, log analysis, faceted search. ELK stack. Resource intensive.

### Data Warehouses

**Snowflake:** Cloud-native, separated compute/storage, multi-cloud.
**BigQuery:** Serverless, petabyte scale, Google Cloud ML integration.

## Requirements Checklist

Before selecting a database, document:

- [ ] Current and projected data volume.
- [ ] Read and write rates (requests per second).
- [ ] Consistency requirements (strong vs eventual).
- [ ] Query patterns (simple lookups vs complex analytics vs graph traversals).
- [ ] Schema change frequency.
- [ ] Geographic distribution (single region vs multi-region vs global).
- [ ] Availability SLA (what downtime is acceptable).
- [ ] Team expertise and learning curve tolerance.
- [ ] Compliance requirements (data residency, audit trails, encryption).
- [ ] Budget for licensing, infrastructure, and operations.

## Common Patterns

**E-commerce:** PostgreSQL or MySQL (primary data) + Redis (caching) + Elasticsearch (product search).

**IoT / Sensor data:** TimescaleDB or InfluxDB (time-series) + Kafka (ingestion) + PostgreSQL (metadata).

**Social media:** MongoDB (profiles) + Neo4j (relationships) + Cassandra (activity feeds) + Elasticsearch (search) + Redis (sessions).

**Analytics platform:** Snowflake or BigQuery + S3/GCS (data lake) for raw data.

**Global SaaS:** CockroachDB or DynamoDB (multi-region, strong consistency).

## Evolution Path

1. Start with PostgreSQL or MySQL — proven, flexible, good tooling.
2. Monitor bottlenecks with real production load before switching.
3. Move specific workloads to specialized databases when concrete evidence justifies it.
4. Polyglot persistence: use multiple databases, each suited for its access pattern.
5. Align database choice with service boundaries in microservice architectures.
