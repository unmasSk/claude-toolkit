# unmassk-design

**Frontend design toolkit**

Complete frontend design system generation, aesthetic direction, color and typography, purposeful motion, accessible interaction, responsive layout, UX writing, design tokens, component library setup, and AI-native interface patterns.

## What's included

- 1 skill (`unmassk-design`)
- 11 references
- BM25 search engine + 14 CSV databases
- Design system generator

## Quick start

Run `/plugin` in Claude Code and install `unmassk-design` from the marketplace.

## Design system generation

Before any design work, the skill generates a complete design system from a plain-language product description. This is the first step for every new project.

`search.py` queries a BM25-indexed corpus built from 14 CSV databases covering visual patterns, typography pairings, color strategies, product styles, and UI conventions. The `--design-system` flag runs a full generation pipeline: pattern matching, style selection, color palette construction, typography stack recommendation, spacing system, and anti-pattern detection — all scoped to the product category.

Example command:

```
python3 ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/unmassk-design/scripts/search.py 'SaaS dashboard analytics' --design-system -p 'ExampleApp'
```

Example output:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  TARGET: ExampleApp - RECOMMENDED DESIGN SYSTEM                                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

|     Keywords: Multiple charts/widgets, data tables, KPI cards, minimal padding          |
|  COLORS:                                                                                |

|  KEY EFFECTS: Hover tooltips, chart zoom on click, smooth filter animations             |
|  AVOID: Ornate design, no filtering                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Use this output as the foundation for all subsequent design decisions. If the project already has a Tailwind config, tokens file, or Figma variables, read those first and treat them as the source of truth — only generate a new system if none exists.

## References

Eleven reference files provide the knowledge base. The skill loads them on-demand based on the request — not all at startup.

| Reference | Domain |
|---|---|
| `design-principles.md` | Aesthetic philosophy, visual hierarchy, contrast, whitespace, the Impeccable framework |
| `color.md` | Color theory, palette construction, dark mode implementation, semantic color tokens, contrast ratios |
| `typography.md` | Font stacks, type scales (fluid and fixed), font pairing rules, OpenType features, typographic correctness |
| `motion.md` | Motion principles, easing curves, duration guidelines, reduced motion, Framer Motion patterns |
| `layout-and-space.md` | Spacing systems, 4pt grid, CSS Grid and Flexbox patterns, z-index scale, visual rhythm |
| `interaction.md` | Focus management, keyboard navigation, form design, ARIA patterns, error states, loading states |
| `responsive.md` | Breakpoint systems, mobile-first approach, container queries, fluid typography, responsive images |
| `ux-writing.md` | Microcopy principles, button labels, error messages, empty states, onboarding copy, voice and tone |
| `design-system-kickoff.md` | Design token structure, Tailwind config scaffolding, shadcn setup, component naming conventions |
| `accessibility.md` | WCAG 2.2 checklist, ARIA roles and properties, screen reader behavior, keyboard interaction patterns |
| `agentic-ux.md` | AI-native interface patterns, memory UI, trust signals, progressive disclosure, error recovery in agentic flows |

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose | Flags |
|---|---|---|
| `search.py` | Query the design reference corpus for patterns, tokens, or a full design system | `--design-system`, `--domain`, `-p` |

### search.py flags

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--design-system` | Generate a complete design system: pattern, style, colors, typography, spacing, effects, anti-patterns |
| `--domain color` | Search color reference only: palettes, dark mode strategies, contrast values |
| `--domain typography` | Search typography reference only: font stacks, type scales, pairing rules |
| `-p '<project name>'` | Scope recommendations to a specific product name and category |

Install dependencies before first run:

```
pip install -r ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/unmassk-design/scripts/requirements.txt
```

`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is auto-resolved by Claude Code. Use it as written in all script invocations.

## User interaction workflow

Before executing any design work, the skill presents 2-3 design system options in plain language. Each option describes the visual feeling in non-technical terms:

- The visual feeling, not the style name ("elegant and calm" not "Soft UI Evolution")
- The color palette as a simple list with descriptive names
- The typography choice by mood ("sophisticated serif" not "Cormorant Garamond")

The skill offers to generate quick HTML mockups so the user can see the options before committing. Mockups are saved as `mockup-option-a.html`, `mockup-option-b.html`, etc., and cover header, hero, one content block, and footer.

Execution proceeds only after the user selects a direction.

| Request type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Subjective (colors, style, vibes) | Present 2-3 options with plain descriptions, offer mockups |
| Technical (animation, responsive, accessibility) | Execute directly, no options needed |
| Explicit (specific color, specific font) | Execute without asking |
| Partial change ("same style, different colors") | Re-run `search.py` for the changed domain only, keep everything else |
| Full reset ("start over") | Return to initial design direction step |

## Design commands

These are the 17 user-facing actions the skill understands. The first ten are steering commands from Impeccable — treat each as a precise instruction, not a vague request.

| Command / Request | What it does | References loaded |
|---|---|---|
| `audit` | Technical quality checks: contrast ratios, spacing consistency, type scale, ARIA coverage, touch targets, motion safety | `design-principles.md` + `accessibility.md` |
| `critique` | UX review focused on hierarchy, clarity, emotional tone, and whether the design communicates its intent | `design-principles.md` |
| `polish` | Final pass before shipping: tighten spacing, fix orphaned text, verify alignment, confirm hover states, check empty states | `design-principles.md` + `typography.md` |
| `bolder` | Amplify a design that is too safe or forgettable — increase contrast, add color, add weight, add motion | `design-principles.md` + `color.md` + `motion.md` |
| `quieter` | Tone down a design that is overly loud or cluttered — reduce contrast, desaturate, simplify | `design-principles.md` + `color.md` |
| `animate` | Add purposeful motion: define what moves, when, how fast, and why — justify every animation against user benefit | `motion.md` |
| `colorize` | Introduce strategic color into a neutral or monochrome design — expand palette, establish hierarchy through color | `color.md` |
| `distill` | Strip the design to its essential elements — remove decorative noise, collapse redundant structure | `design-principles.md` + `layout-and-space.md` |
| `harden` | Add error handling, validation states, loading states, i18n-safe layouts, and edge cases the happy path hides | `interaction.md` + `ux-writing.md` |
| `normalize` | Align a component or screen with the project's design system — standardize tokens, replace one-offs, enforce grid | `design-system-kickoff.md` |
| Design philosophy, aesthetic direction | Explain what makes good design for this context | `design-principles.md` |
| Colors, palettes, dark mode | Color selection, contrast auditing, dark mode strategy | `color.md` |
| Fonts, type scale, font pairing | Typography selection and scale decisions | `typography.md` |
| Spacing, grids, layout systems | Layout structure, spacing audit, grid setup | `layout-and-space.md` |
| Forms, focus states, keyboard navigation | Form design, interactive components, ARIA | `interaction.md` |
| Breakpoints, mobile-first, responsive | Responsive design, mobile audit, breakpoint planning | `responsive.md` |
| AI interfaces, agentic UX, memory UI | AI-native product design, trust signals, agentic flows | `agentic-ux.md` |
