# Enterprise Quality Standards

> Executable reference for AI agents. Binary rules (IF/THEN).
> Quality test: if two AIs read the same rule, they reach the same action.

---

## 1. Tier System

Every rule and finding has a tier. The tier determines whether it blocks merge.

| Tier | Scope | Blocks merge | Action |
|------|-------|--------------|--------|
| T1 | Security, data integrity, crashes | Yes, always | Immediate fix |
| T2 | Error handling, testing core, structure | Yes, unless written justification | Fix before merge |
| T3 | JSDoc, naming, cosmetics, extra coverage | No | Fix when convenient |

### Finding Classification by Tier

| Finding | Tier |
|---------|------|
| Concatenated SQL (injection) | T1 |
| `SELECT *` in read queries (use explicit columns) | T2 |
| `RETURNING *` in INSERT/UPDATE (use explicit columns) | T2 |
| Possible auth bypass | T1 |
| Hardcoded secret | T1 |
| Unhandled error that crashes process | T1 |
| Critical data without validation | T1 |
| Environment guard with blacklist (`!== 'production'`) | T1 |
| Generic `throw new Error()` in service (use typed error classes) | T2 |
| `as Type` cast without justification comment | T2 |
| Dead export (no consumers in production code) | T3 |
| Level A service function without requestId | T2 |
| API module without happy path test | T2 |
| File >300 LOC without split | T2 |
| Manual validation instead of Zod | T2 |
| `console.log` in committed code | T2 |
| Line coverage below 97% | T3 |
| Branch coverage below 85% | T3 |
| Excessive JSDoc on helper | T3 |
| Missing `performance.now()` on internal helper | T3 |
| Unused import | T3 |
| Naming inconsistent with project conventions | T3 |

IF uncertain about tier THEN assign T2 (neither blocks everything nor gets ignored).

### Execution Priority (Business Order)

When multiple findings or tasks exist, execute in this order:

1. **Security** -- auth bypass, SQL injection, exposed secrets, broken guards
2. **Data integrity** -- validation, permissions, unprotected destructive operations
3. **Critical happy paths** -- main routes functioning without crash
4. **Structure and testing** -- typed error handling, API tests, file size limits
5. **Cleanup** -- JSDoc, naming, imports, cosmetics

IF a module has T1 security findings AND T3 JSDoc findings THEN fix security first. NEVER touch JSDoc while T1 findings remain open.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### SOLID

- **Single Responsibility**: one class/method = one job
- **Open/Closed**: open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: subtypes must be substitutable for base types
- **Interface Segregation**: many specific interfaces > one general
- **Dependency Inversion**: depend on abstractions, not concretions

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Extract after 2nd duplication. IF pattern repeats 3+ times THEN abstraction is mandatory.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

The simplest solution that works. IF abstraction requires 4+ config params THEN too generic -- simplify.

### YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)

Only implement what is needed NOW. No speculative features, no "just in case" code.

### OWASP Top 10

| OWASP Risk | Project Rule | Tier |
|------------|-------------|------|
| A03: Injection (SQL) | All queries use $1/$2 parameterized. ORDER BY with column whitelist. Zero concatenation. | T1 |
| A01: Broken Access Control | Auth headers validated. Role hierarchy enforced. Mock headers blocked in production. | T1 |
| A02: Cryptographic Failures | Secrets never hardcoded, always via envConfig. Redis URLs sanitized in logs. | T1 |
| A04: Insecure Design | Environment guards use allowlist (`=== 'development'`), never blacklist (`!== 'production'`). | T1 |
| A05: Security Misconfiguration | CORS whitelist explicit, no wildcard in production. Helmet configured. | T1 |
| A07: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | No `innerHTML` with user data. | T1 |
| A08: Software Integrity | Rate limiting applied on all endpoints. | T2 |
| A09: Logging Failures | Generic error messages for 5xx in production. No stack traces in responses. | T2 |

---

## 3. File Size Limits

| Type | Hard limit | Sweet spot |
|------|-----------|------------|
| TypeScript file | 300 LOC | 200-300 |
| Exported function/method | 50 LOC | 15-30 |
| Internal helper function | 30 LOC | 10-20 |
| Nesting level | 3 max | 2 |
| Function parameters | 4 max (requestId no cuenta) | 3 (use object if more) |
| Test file | 500 LOC | 200-400 |
| Controller method | 50 LOC | 20-30 |
| React component | 300 LOC | 150-200 |
| CSS file | 800 LOC | 300-500 |
| Cyclomatic complexity | 10 max | 5-8 |
| Imports per service/controller | 12 max | 8-10 |
| Imports per helper/schema | 8-10 max | 5-7 |
| Exports per service file | 8 max (barrels exempt) | 5-6 |
| Object options fields | 8 max | 5-6 |
| SQL inline per query | 20 lines max | 10-15 |

LOC = total lines of code (not executable-only).

```
IF file > 300 LOC THEN mandatory split (T2)
IF file 200-300 LOC AND has 2+ responsibilities THEN recommended split
IF file 200-300 LOC AND has 1 responsibility THEN do NOT split
IF file < 200 LOC THEN do NOT split
```

**What is "responsibility"** (binary definition):
IF all functions in the file need the same mocks in tests THEN 1 responsibility.
IF different groups need different mocks THEN 2+ responsibilities.

---

## 4. Project Context

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| Backend stack | Node.js 22+ / Express 5 / TypeScript (ESM strict) |
| Frontend stack | React 18 / TypeScript / Vite |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 + PostGIS 3.3 (Supabase cloud) |
| Cache | Upstash Redis (cloud) |
| Validation | Zod |
| Logging | Winston + Morgan |
| Testing | Vitest |
| Monitoring | Sentry |
| Auth (dev) | Mock headers (X-Mock-User-ID, X-Mock-User-Role) |
| Auth (prod) | JWT (pending full implementation) |

---

## 5. Mandatory Patterns

### 4.1 Service Layer: Exported Functions (NOT classes)

Service functions have two levels based on caller:

**Level A -- Entry point** (called directly by route handler):

| Requirement | Tier if missing |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `requestId` as parameter | T2 |
| `createLoggerWithContext` with requestId, service, action | T2 |
| `performance.now()` for duration | T3 |
| Duration log on completion | T3 |
| Typed errors from system classes (never generic `new Error()`) | T2 (T1 if leaks sensitive info or breaks security error handler) |
| Re-throw AppError without wrapping | T2 |

**Level B -- Internal helper** (called by another service function):

| Requirement | Tier if missing |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Typed errors if it throws | T1 |
| requestId only if it runs queries or has its own logging | T2 |
| Does NOT need its own logger | - |
| Does NOT need performance.now() | - |

**How to distinguish:**
IF function appears in a route handler THEN Level A.
IF function is called by another service function THEN Level B.
IF uncertain THEN Level B (less ceremony > more ceremony).

### 4.2 Route Handler

| Requirement | Tier if missing |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Rate limiter applied | T2 |
| Validation via Zod middleware (validateParams/Query/Body) | T2 |
| `try/catch` with `next(error)` | T1 |
| Extract requestId from typed req | T2 |
| NEVER `res.status(4xx).json()` direct (delegate to error handler) | T2 |

### 4.3 Error Handling

Use ALWAYS the system error classes (`utils/errors.ts`):

| Class | HTTP | Usage |
|-------|------|-------|
| `ValidationError` | 400 | Invalid input data |
| `AuthenticationError` | 401 | Missing or invalid token |
| `PermissionError` | 403 | No permissions for action |
| `NotFoundError` | 404 | Resource not found |
| `ConflictError` | 409 | Data conflict (unique constraint) |
| `DatabaseError` | 500 | Database error |
| `AppError` | variable | Generic application error |

IF service throws generic `new Error()` THEN finding T2.
IF route handler responds with `res.status().json()` directly THEN finding T2.

**Exception: boot-time initialization errors**
IF throw occurs during process initialization (before Express starts) THEN generic `new Error()` is acceptable -- `AppError` classes with HTTP status codes have no meaning outside the request lifecycle.

### 4.4 Zod Validation

Schemas in separate file `module.schemas.ts`. Always `.strict()`.

| Rule | Tier if missing |
|------|-----------------|
| `.strict()` on all object schemas | T2 |
| String-to-number transforms in params/query | T2 |
| Export inferred types | T3 |
| Schemas in separate file (not inline in routes) | T3 |

### 4.5 SQL Queries

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| ALWAYS parameterized with $1, $2 | T1 |
| ORDER BY with column whitelist | T1 |
| NEVER `SELECT *` — use explicit columns. If only checking existence, use `SELECT 1` | T2 |
| NEVER `RETURNING *` — use explicit columns in RETURNING clause | T2 |
| PostGIS: store EPSG:4326, transform to 3857 only for MVT | T2 |
| `&&` operator (bbox) before ST_Intersects | T2 |

---

## 6. JSDoc Policy

### What to Document

| Element | JSDoc | Content |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Exported function with non-obvious params | Yes | 1-2 line description, @throws if applicable |
| Exported interface/type | Yes | Brief description |
| Non-obvious exported constant | Yes | Brief description |
| Internal helper | No | Only if logic is non-evident |
| Trivial getter/setter | No | Never |
| Function whose name already says it | No | `validateParams` needs no JSDoc |

### Prohibited Tags

NEVER use: `@audit`, `@security`, `@module`, `@file`, `@requires`.
NEVER use `@see` unless linking to a real external spec.
NEVER repeat TypeScript signature in JSDoc (`@param id: number - the id` is redundant).

### Tags to Remove

- `@description` (first line IS the description)
- `@param {Type}` (remove {Type}, keep `@param name - desc`)
- `@returns {Type}` (remove {Type}, keep `@returns desc`)
- `@returns {void}` (remove completely)
- `@function`, `@const`, `@interface`, `@property {Type}`, `@typedef`
- `@module`, `@file`, `@requires`, `@since`, `@see`
- `@audit` tags (temporary, remove when fix applied)
- File-level header blocks (remove entirely)
- JSDoc longer than the function it documents

### Tags to Keep

- `@throws` with description
- `@example` with code
- `@summary` (no type, 1 line)
- `@param name - description` (no type)
- `@returns description` (no type)

RULE: Maximum 4 lines of description. IF more is needed, the code is too complex -- refactor.
IF JSDoc has more lines than the function THEN finding T3.

---

## 7. Testing Policy

### What to Test by Module Type

**Security module** (auth, permissions, access middleware):

| Test | Tier |
|------|------|
| Happy path (valid access) | T2 |
| Missing token/header | T1 |
| Manipulated token/header | T1 |
| Privilege escalation (lower role, higher action) | T1 |
| Environment guards: mock headers blocked in prod | T1 |

**API module** (service + routes):

| Test | Tier |
|------|------|
| Happy path (successful flow) | T2 |
| Invalid input (Zod validation error) | T2 |
| Resource not found (404) | T2 |
| DB error (mock failed query) | T2 |
| Insufficient permissions | T1 if sensitive data, T2 if not |

**Utility module** (helpers, formatters, config):

| Test | Tier |
|------|------|
| Happy path | T3 |
| Input edge cases | T3 |

### What NOT to Test

- Getters without logic
- Re-exports from facades
- External library behavior (Zod, Express, Helmet)
- Every possible parameter combination (cover boundaries, not exhaustive)

### Test Quality Rules

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| AAA pattern (Arrange-Act-Assert) | T3 |
| `vi.clearAllMocks()` in `beforeEach` | T2 |
| Auth mock in integration: `.set('X-Mock-User-ID', '1').set('X-Mock-User-Role', 'Coordinador')` | T2 |
| Mock logger to avoid output in tests | T3 |
| Tautological assertions (`expect(true).toBe(true)`) | T2 -- forbidden |
| Tests depending on execution order | T2 -- forbidden |
| Mocks replicating production logic | T2 -- forbidden |

### Singleton Reset for Tests

Modules with singletons (DB pool, Redis client, cache) must export `__resetForTests()` functions.
Prefix `__` indicates internal API for tests. NEVER call in production code.
Only export `__reset*` if the module has mutable state (singleton, cache, global Map).

---

## 8. Security

### Critical Data Traceability (T1)

For EACH critical datum that crosses the module:

1. **Where is it SENT?** (origin: client, service, config)
2. **Where is it CONSUMED?** (destination: middleware, service, route)
3. **Who BLOCKS it?** (validation, auth, sanitization)

IF no blocker exists THEN finding T1 CRITICAL.
IF data reaches production without validation THEN finding T1 CRITICAL.

Critical data = credentials, tokens, user IDs, roles, geolocation, SQL parameters.

### Security Checklist

| Rule | Verification | Tier |
|------|-------------|------|
| SQL injection | Parameterized queries ($1, $2) | T1 |
| XSS | No innerHTML with user data | T1 |
| Auth bypass | Mock headers blocked in prod | T1 |
| Secrets | Zero hardcoded, all via envConfig | T1 |
| CORS | Explicit whitelist, no wildcard in prod | T1 |
| Environment guards | Allowlist, not blacklist | T1 |
| Rate limiting | Applied on endpoints | T2 |
| Errors in prod | Generic messages for 5xx | T2 |
| Permissions | Validated in service layer | T1 |

### Roles

```
Coordinador > Supervisor > Tecnico > Municipio
```

Permissions inherit downward. Municipio requires `municipio_id` validated in Zod schema.

### Environment Guards

```typescript
// CORRECT: explicit allowlist
if (envConfig.NODE_ENV === 'development' || envConfig.NODE_ENV === 'test') {
  // development feature
}

// INCORRECT: fragile blacklist (staging, uat, prod1 slip through)
if (envConfig.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  // development feature
}
```

RULE: Guards ALWAYS with allowlist, never blacklist (T1).

---

## 9. Logging and Observability

### Format (Level A Functions)

```typescript
import { createLoggerWithContext } from '../../config/logger.js';

const contextLogger = createLoggerWithContext({
  requestId,
  service: 'inventario.service',
  action: 'findById',
});

contextLogger.info('Completado', { duration: durationMs, resultCount: results.length });
contextLogger.error('Error consultando DB', { error: error.message, duration: durationMs });
```

### Log Levels

| Level | Usage | Example |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `error` | Non-recoverable failure | DB down, crash |
| `warn` | Abnormal but recoverable | Rate limit, cache miss |
| `info` | Significant operations | Request completed, tile generated |
| `debug` | Troubleshooting detail | Params received, queries |

RULE: NEVER `console.log()` or `console.error()` (T2).

**Exception: boot-time logging**
IF logging occurs before Winston is available THEN a designated `bootLogger` using `console` is acceptable. The file must document explicitly why it does not use Winston.

### requestId Propagation

requestId is generated in `middleware/request-id.ts` and propagated to:
- Level A service functions (mandatory parameter)
- Logs (via createLoggerWithContext)
- Sentry (scope.setTag)
- Response header (X-Request-ID)

IF Level A function does not receive requestId THEN finding T2.
IF Level B function runs queries without requestId THEN finding T2.

---

## 10. Performance

### Thresholds

| Metric | Normal | Slow | Critical |
|--------|--------|------|----------|
| API response | <100ms | <500ms | >1000ms |
| SQL query | <100ms | <500ms | >1000ms |
| Tile generation | <200ms | <1000ms | >2000ms |

IF endpoint consistently exceeds "slow" THEN propose optimization (T2).

### PostGIS

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| GIST indexes on geometry columns used in spatial queries | T2 |
| `&&` operator (bbox) BEFORE ST_Intersects | T2 |
| ST_Transform at the end, not in intermediates | T2 |
| ST_AsMVT with ST_AsMVTGeom for tiles | T2 |
| Simplification by zoom (ST_Simplify / ST_SnapToGrid) | T3 |

---

## 11. Decision Trees

### When to Split a File

```
IF file > 300 LOC
  THEN mandatory split (T2)

IF file 200-300 LOC AND has 2+ responsibilities
  THEN recommended split

IF file 200-300 LOC AND has 1 responsibility
  THEN do NOT split

IF file < 200 LOC
  THEN do NOT split
```

When splitting:
- Each resulting module < 300 LOC
- NEVER modules under 30 LOC (overhead > benefit)
- Facade re-export ONLY if existing external consumers exist
- NEVER extract function to own file if called only once (over-splitting)
- IF function used from only one place THEN keep it in the consuming file

### When to Extract to shared/utils

```
IF function used in 2 modules
  THEN note, do not extract yet

IF function used in 3+ modules
  THEN mandatory extraction to utils/ or shared/

IF type/interface used in 2+ modules
  THEN move to types/

IF helper specific to one module
  THEN keep it there (do not pollute utils/)
```

### When to Create Abstraction

```
IF pattern repeats 2 times
  THEN note the duplication, do not abstract

IF pattern repeats 3+ times
  THEN mandatory abstraction

IF abstraction requires 4+ config params
  THEN too generic, simplify

IF abstraction saves <5 LOC per use
  THEN repeated code is clearer
```

### When to Refactor vs Leave Alone

```
IF works + has tests + under limits
  THEN do NOT touch (do not refactor for aesthetics)

IF works but violates T1 rule
  THEN mandatory fix

IF works but violates T2 rule
  THEN report, propose fix

IF works but violates T3 rule
  THEN report, optional fix

IF duplication 3+
  THEN propose abstraction with before/after

IF change affects auth/permissions/data
  THEN STOP, request confirmation
```

---

## 12. Dead Code Policy

### Dead Exports (T3)

IF an exported function, type, constant, or interface has zero consumers in production code THEN it is dead code.

Rules:
- Exports consumed ONLY in tests are NOT dead code (test infrastructure is valid)
- Exports consumed ONLY internally in the same file SHOULD be made private (remove `export`)
- Exports with zero consumers anywhere (not even tests) MUST be deleted
- Before deleting, grep the entire `src/` directory (excluding `__tests__/`) to confirm zero consumers
- Schema files (*.schemas.ts) and type files (*.types.ts) acting as barrels are exempt from the 8-export limit but dead schemas within them should still be cleaned

### `as Type` Casts (T2)

Every `as Type` cast MUST have a justification comment on the line above explaining WHY the cast is safe.

```typescript
// CORRECT: justified cast
// Body validated by Zod middleware — type is guaranteed
const data = req.body as CreateInventarioInput;

// CORRECT: justified cast
// pg returns unknown, we verify structure in formatRow
const row = result.rows[0] as InventarioRow;

// INCORRECT: unjustified cast
const data = req.body as CreateInventarioInput;

// INCORRECT: optimistic cast without guarantee
return sanitized as T;
```

Exceptions (no comment needed):
- `as const` (compile-time, zero runtime risk)
- `as unknown as Type` in test mocks (test infrastructure)

### `throw new Error()` Generic (T2)

Production code MUST use typed error classes from the error system (`AppError`, `ValidationError`, `DatabaseError`, etc.).

```
IF throw new Error() in service/controller/middleware THEN T2 finding
IF throw new Error() in boot-time config (before Express starts) THEN acceptable (HTTP status codes have no meaning pre-startup)
IF throw new Error() in CLI scripts (not API code) THEN T3 (lower priority)
```

### Coverage Targets

| Metric | Target | Tier if below |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| Line coverage | >97% | T3 |
| Branch coverage | >85% | T3 |

---

## 13. Anti-Patterns

Real errors from existing code. Reference of what NOT to do.

### 13.1 Duplicated instanceof Chain

```typescript
// ANTI-PATTERN: 10 identical blocks with instanceof
if (err instanceof ValidationError) {
  logger.warn(`Error: ${err.message}`, { requestId });
  res.status(err.statusCode).json(createErrorResponse({ ... }));
  return true;
}
if (err instanceof AuthenticationError) {
  // ... identical block
}

// FIX: Map of error class to config, single handler
const ERROR_HANDLERS = new Map<Function, { level: 'warn' | 'error' }>([
  [ValidationError, { level: 'warn' }],
  [AuthenticationError, { level: 'warn' }],
]);

for (const [ErrorClass, config] of ERROR_HANDLERS) {
  if (err instanceof ErrorClass) {
    contextLogger[config.level](`Error: ${err.message}`, { requestId });
    res.status(err.statusCode).json(createErrorResponse({ ... }));
    return true;
  }
}
```

### 13.2 JSDoc as Decoration

```typescript
// ANTI-PATTERN: more comment than code
/**
 * @description Handles request without Origin header
 * @param {CorsOriginCallback} callback - CORS callback
 * @audit FIX-SRP-006: Extracted from createOriginValidator
 */
export function handleNoOrigin(callback: CorsOriginCallback): void {

// FIX: TypeScript already types the parameters
/** Accepts requests without Origin (same-origin, curl, etc). */
export function handleNoOrigin(callback: CorsOriginCallback): void {
```

### 13.3 Over-Splitting (Excessive Granularity)

Split when the module has its own entity (>30 LOC, responsibility that can grow). Not by dogmatic SRP.

### 13.4 Unnecessary Deep Freeze

```typescript
// ANTI-PATTERN: deepFreeze runtime for object nobody mutates
function deepFreeze<T>(obj: T): Readonly<T> { ... } // 15 LOC
const CONFIG = deepFreeze({ ... });

// FIX: as const (compile-time, zero runtime overhead)
const CONFIG = { ... } as const;
```

### 13.5 Duplicated validate* Functions

```typescript
// ANTI-PATTERN: 3 identical functions changing only req.body/query/params

// FIX: one parameterized function
const createValidator = (section: 'body' | 'query' | 'params') =>
  <T extends ZodSchema>(schema: T) =>
    (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
      try {
        req[section] = schema.parse(req[section]);
        next();
      } catch (error) {
        handleValidationError(context, error, req, res, next);
      }
    };

export const validateBody = createValidator('body');
export const validateQuery = createValidator('query');
export const validateParams = createValidator('params');
```

### 13.6 Permanent @audit Tags

```typescript
// ANTI-PATTERN: audit tags as permanent documentation
/** @audit FIX-SRP-007: Extracted from createOriginValidator */
/** @security CRIT-CORS-001: Normalization prevents bypass */
```

Audit tags are temporary. Once the fix is applied, remove them. Git preserves history.

## 13. Error Response Contract

Every API error response follows the contract defined in `middleware/error.handler.types.ts`.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `status` | `'error'` | Yes | Always the string literal `'error'` |
| `message` | `string` | Yes | Human-readable message for consumer |
| `requestId` | `string` | Yes | Request UUID (traceability) |
| `error` | `string` | No | Brief technical error description |
| `errors` | `Array<{ field, message, code? }>` | No | Zod validation error list |
| `errorCode` | `string` | No | Internal error class code (e.g., `NOT_FOUND`) |
| `errorId` | `string` | No | Sentry ID if error was reported |
| `details` | `Record<string, unknown>` | No | Additional details (sanitized by environment) |

**Sanitization rule**: Production shows only whitelisted fields (`validationErrors`). Dev/Test shows everything except `originalError`.

IF creating a new endpoint THEN error response MUST follow this contract. NEVER build error JSON manually -- delegate to `next(error)` and the global error handler.

IF error is 5xx and `NODE_ENV === 'production'` THEN message is replaced with generic text. NEVER filter `details` manually -- `safeDetailsForClient` does it automatically.

---

## 14. Dependency Policy

IF functionality can be solved in <30 LOC THEN implement it in the project. NEVER add a dependency for something trivial.

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Dependency for trivial functionality (left-pad, isEven) | T2 |
| Dependency without TypeScript types (nor `@types/*`) | T2 |
| `npm install` without `--save` or `--save-dev` explicit | T3 |
| Private fork of OSS library without justification | T2 |
| `npm audit` with HIGH/CRITICAL vulnerabilities before merge | T2 |
| Dependency with HIGH/CRITICAL CVE and no patch available | T1 |

---

## 15. Environment Variables

EVERY environment variable MUST be validated by `envConfig` (defined in `config/env.validator.ts`).

```typescript
// CORRECT: access via validated envConfig
import { envConfig } from '../config/env.validator.js';
const port = envConfig.PORT;

// INCORRECT: direct access -- NEVER in application code
const port = process.env.PORT;
```

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Direct `process.env` in application code (services, middleware, routes) | T2 |
| New variable without Zod schema in `env/schema.ts` | T2 |
| New variable without entry in `.env.example` | T3 |
| Secret without entropy validation | T2 |

**Permitted exceptions**: `config/env/*.ts` (the validator itself), `config/logger/*.ts` (terminal detection), `scripts/*.ts` (standalone CLI), `**/__tests__/*.ts` (test scenarios).

---

## 16. Rate Limiting

### Decision Tree

```
IF auth endpoint (login, register)
  THEN windowMs = 5 min, max = 5 req/window

IF password reset endpoint
  THEN windowMs = 1 hour, max = 3 req/window

IF tiles / high-frequency endpoint (zoom, pan)
  THEN windowMs = 5 min, max = 500 req/window

IF general API endpoint (CRUD, queries)
  THEN use defaults: windowMs = 15 min, max = 100 (prod) / 1000 (dev)

IF critical/destructive operations (bulk DELETE, bulk UPDATE)
  THEN windowMs = 5 min, max = 50 req/window (STRICT)
```

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| New endpoint without rate limiter | T2 |
| Auth endpoint without strict rate limiter | T1 |
| Custom limit with magic numbers (use `RATE_LIMIT_CONFIG` constants) | T2 |

### Behavior by Environment

| Environment | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| `test` | Rate limiting disabled |
| `development` | Private/local IPs exempt; high limit (1000 req) |
| `production` | Strict limits; all IPs controlled |

---

## 17. Cache Strategy (Redis)

IF cache is needed in a new module THEN use `saveToCache()` / `getFromCache()` from `services/cache.service.ts`. NEVER call `getRedisClient().set()` directly.

### Key Naming Convention

Pattern: `{domain}:{entity-or-operation}:{specific-identifiers}`

IF new key does not follow `domain:entity:id` pattern THEN finding T3.
IF key contains sensitive data (tokens, passwords) THEN finding T1.

### TTL Guidelines

```
CACHE:
  IF reference data that changes rarely (municipios, layers, catastro) THEN long cache (1h-7d)
  IF expensive geospatial operations (tiles, buffer, intersect) THEN medium cache (15min-24h)
  IF search results / nearby THEN short cache (5-15min)
  IF user permissions THEN medium cache (30min-1h)

DO NOT CACHE:
  IF write operation (POST, PUT, DELETE) THEN NEVER cache response
  IF sensitive data (tokens, credentials) THEN NEVER in Redis
  IF data that changes every request (timestamps, counters) THEN pointless
```

### Fail-Open Pattern

Cache service implements fail-open: if Redis is unavailable, a warning is logged and execution continues without cache. A Redis failure must NOT bring down the API.

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Fail-open: if Redis fails, main operation must NOT fail | T2 |
| NEVER `flushdb()` in production | T1 |
| Custom TTL with inline magic number | T3 (use constant if repeated 2+ times) |
| Cache of sensitive data in Redis | T1 |
| Read endpoint without cache when operation is costly (>200ms) | T3 |

---

## 18. Naming Conventions

| Element | Convention | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Variables/functions | camelCase | `getUserById` |
| Classes/interfaces/types | PascalCase | `AuthUser`, `TileParams` |
| Constants | UPPER_SNAKE_CASE | `MAX_RETRIES` |
| Module files | kebab-case | `error-handler.middleware.ts` |
| Test files | `*.test.ts` | `tiles.service.test.ts` |
| Directories | kebab-case | `query-executor/` |
| Zod schemas | PascalCase + Schema | `TileParamsSchema` |
| Zod types | PascalCase + Input/Output | `CreateInventarioInput` |

### Language in Code

| Element | Language |
|---------|----------|
| Comments and JSDoc | Match the project's existing convention |
| Variable/function names | English (camelCase) |
| User-facing error messages | Match the project's existing convention |
| Log messages | Match the project's existing convention |
| TODO/FIXME/STUB | Match the project's existing convention |

RULE: comments, user-facing error messages, log messages, and TODO/FIXME/STUB follow whatever language the project's existing codebase already uses — check existing comments/messages before writing new ones. If greenfield with no existing convention, default to English (the common baseline for shared/multi-contributor code) unless the user explicitly states a different project language. Identifiers (variable/function/class names) are always in English (camelCase) regardless of comment language — this is a near-universal industry convention independent of natural language. Do not mix languages arbitrarily within the same file; follow the detected convention consistently. Violation = T3.

---

## 19. Code Format

| Rule | Value |
|------|-------|
| Semicolons | Required |
| Quotes | Single |
| Indentation | 2 spaces |
| Max line length | 100 characters |
| Trailing commas | Required in multiline |
| Imports | Grouped: 1) external, 2) internal |
| Relative imports | ALWAYS with `.js` extension (ESM requirement) |
| Type-only imports | Use `import type` when import is used only as type |

---

## 20. Existing Infrastructure (DO NOT Duplicate)

| Feature | Location | API |
|---------|----------|-----|
| Zod validation | `middleware/validation.middleware.ts` | `validateParams()`, `validateQuery()`, `validateBody()` |
| Rate limiting | `middleware/rate-limit.middleware.ts` | `getRateLimitMiddleware()`, `RATE_LIMIT_CONFIG` |
| Error handling | `middleware/error.handler.middleware.ts` | Global centralized middleware |
| Request ID | `middleware/request-id.ts` | UUID per request, `X-Request-ID` header |
| Logging | `config/logger.ts` | `createLoggerWithContext()` |
| Database | `config/database.ts` | `query()` parameterized |
| Redis | `config/redis.ts` | `getRedisClient()` |
| Error classes | `utils/errors.ts` | `DatabaseError`, `ValidationError`, `PermissionError`, etc. |

IF a function already exists in this table THEN use it. NEVER create a custom version.

---

## 21. Reference Model Files

These files represent the target quality level. Copy structure for new modules.

| File | Why it is a model |
|------|-------------------|
| `backend/src/api/tiles/tiles.service.ts` | Service with metrics, logging, error handling |
| `backend/src/api/tiles/tiles.schemas.ts` | Zod with string-to-number transform, exported types |
| `backend/src/api/tiles/tiles.routes.ts` | Routes with rate limiting, validation, OpenAPI |
| `backend/src/config/morgan/skip.ts` | Perfect SRP: ~26 executable LOC, one responsibility |

## 22. Audit Scoring

### Closed Checklist by Dimension

#### Security (x3)

- [ ] SQL: all queries use $1/$2 parameterized (0 concatenation)
- [ ] Environment guards: allowlist (`=== 'production'`), NOT blacklist
- [ ] Secrets: never logged in clear (Redis URLs sanitized, tokens not in logs)
- [ ] Auth bypass: no routes skip permission validation
- [ ] Input validation: user data validated with Zod before use
- [ ] Cast `as any` / `as Type`: only with documented justification

#### Error Handling (x3)

- [ ] Typed errors: uses system classes (AuthenticationError, DatabaseError, etc.), NOT `throw new Error()`
- [ ] Routes/middleware: errors delegated with `next(error)`, NOT `res.status(500).json()` direct
- [ ] try/catch: all async service functions have catch with logging
- [ ] Contextual logging: errors logged with context (userId, requestId, operation)
- [ ] Correct re-throw: errors not silently swallowed (except intentional cache invalidation)

#### Structure (x2)

- [ ] LOC < 500 per file (HARD LIMIT)
- [ ] Functions < 50 LOC
- [ ] Factory pattern: exported functions, NOT classes in service layer
- [ ] Level A service: receives requestId (optional ok) and creates contextLogger
- [ ] Separation: types in .types.ts files, queries separated, helpers extracted
- [ ] No significant duplication (same logic in 2+ places without abstraction)
- [ ] Imports: no circular, with .js extension

#### Testing (x2)

- [ ] Tests exist for ALL files with business logic
- [ ] Tests pass 100% (run 2 times)
- [ ] Real assertions (not tautological)
- [ ] Happy path + error paths covered
- [ ] NOTE: stub/pending files do NOT penalize for missing dedicated tests

#### Maintainability (x1)

- [ ] JSDoc: conforms to section 5 (no @description, no @param {Type}, no @returns {Type}, no @requires)
- [ ] Comments follow project's existing language convention
- [ ] Named constants (no magic numbers/strings)
- [ ] No dead code, console.log, debugger, unused imports
- [ ] No emojis in log messages (descriptive text)

### Scoring Rules

- Each dimension is scored 0-10 based ONLY on checklist items
- 10/10 = all items pass
- 9/10 = 1 item fails or has minor finding
- 8/10 = 2+ items fail
- <8/10 = serious problems
- Do NOT invent criteria outside the checklist
- IF something works correctly and violates no checklist item THEN it is NOT a finding

### Weighted Score Calculation

| Dimension | Score | Weight | Total |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Security | X/10 | x3 | XX |
| Error Handling | X/10 | x3 | XX |
| Structure | X/10 | x2 | XX |

---

## 25. React Component Patterns

### Component Types

| Type | Max LOC | What it does |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Page component | 200 | Layout + composition of smaller components. No business logic. |
| Feature component | 300 | Business logic + state. Contains hooks, handlers. |
| UI component | 100 | Pure presentational. Props in, JSX out. Zero side effects. |
| Layout component | 100 | Grid, spacing, wrappers. Children only. |

```
IF component > 300 LOC THEN mandatory split (T2)
IF component has business logic AND presentation mixed THEN split into container + presentational (T2)
IF component has 5+ useState THEN extract to custom hook (T2)
IF component has 3+ useEffect THEN refactor -- too many side effects (T2)
```

### Rules

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Functional components only. NEVER class components. | T2 |
| Props destructured in signature | T3 |
| Default exports for page components, named exports for everything else | T3 |
| NEVER inline function definitions in JSX `onClick={() => { ...10 lines }}` -- extract to handler | T2 |
| NEVER nested component definitions (component inside component) | T2 |
| Props interface in same file if used once, in `.types.ts` if shared | T3 |
| `children` typed as `React.ReactNode` | T3 |
| NEVER `any` in props interface without justification comment | T2 |

### Custom Hooks

```
IF logic is reused in 2+ components THEN extract to custom hook
IF component has complex state machine THEN extract to custom hook
IF hook > 50 LOC THEN split into smaller hooks (T2)
IF hook name does not start with `use` THEN finding T2
```

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Custom hooks in `hooks/` directory | T3 |
| Hook returns typed object, not positional array (unless 2 values like useState) | T3 |
| Hook with side effects must handle cleanup in return of useEffect | T2 |

### Error Boundaries

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Error boundary at route/page level | T2 |
| Error boundary around async data-fetching sections | T2 |
| Fallback UI must be user-friendly (not stack trace) | T2 |
| Error boundary must log to monitoring (Sentry or equivalent) | T2 |
| NEVER wrap entire app in single error boundary only -- granular boundaries per route | T2 |

```
IF page fetches data THEN must have error boundary (T2)
IF error boundary has no fallback UI THEN finding T2
IF only one error boundary for entire app THEN finding T2
```

### Forms

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Validation schema shared with backend (Zod) when possible | T3 |
| Client-side validation before submit | T2 |
| Error messages displayed next to the field, not only in alert/toast | T2 |
| Submit button disabled while submitting (prevent double submit) | T2 |
| Form state reset on successful submit (unless edit mode) | T3 |
| NEVER uncontrolled inputs for forms that submit data | T2 |

### Accessibility (in code)

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Semantic HTML: `<button>` for actions, `<a>` for navigation, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>` | T2 |
| All `<img>` must have `alt` attribute (empty string `alt=""` for decorative) | T2 |
| Interactive custom elements must have `role`, `aria-label`, and keyboard handler (`onKeyDown`) | T2 |
| Form inputs must have associated `<label>` (via `htmlFor` or wrapping) | T2 |
| Color must NOT be the only indicator (add icon or text) | T3 |
| Focus must be visible on all interactive elements | T2 |
| Tab order must be logical (no positive `tabIndex` values) | T2 |
| NEVER `div` or `span` with `onClick` without `role="button"` and `tabIndex={0}` and `onKeyDown` | T2 |
| Modals must trap focus | T2 |
| Page must have exactly one `<h1>` | T3 |
| Heading hierarchy must not skip levels (h1 → h3 without h2) | T3 |

---

## 26. Frontend State & Data Fetching

### State Management Decision Tree

```
IF state used in 1 component only THEN useState (local)
IF state shared between parent-child (1-2 levels) THEN props drilling
IF state shared 3+ levels deep THEN Context or state library
IF state is server data (API responses) THEN data fetching library cache (NOT manual state)
IF state is complex with many transitions THEN useReducer or state library
IF global UI state (theme, sidebar open, toasts) THEN Context
IF global server state (user session, permissions) THEN data fetching library cache
```

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| NEVER store server response in useState manually if using a data fetching library | T2 |
| NEVER put everything in global state -- local first | T2 |
| Context providers must be as close to consumers as possible (not all at root) | T3 |
| NEVER mutate state directly (spread or immer) | T1 |

### Data Fetching

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| All API calls through a centralized fetcher/client (never raw `fetch` scattered in components) | T2 |
| Loading state must be shown to user (spinner, skeleton, or similar) | T2 |
| Error state must be shown to user (not silent failure) | T2 |
| Retry logic on transient network errors (at least 1 retry) | T3 |
| NEVER fetch in useEffect without cleanup / abort controller | T2 |
| Request cancellation on component unmount | T2 |
| Optimistic updates must have rollback on error | T2 |

### Client Cache

```
IF data is read-heavy and changes rarely THEN cache with stale-while-revalidate
IF data is user-specific and changes frequently THEN short TTL or no cache
IF mutation succeeds THEN invalidate related cache keys (not manual refetch everywhere)
```

---

## 27. Frontend Testing

### What to Test by Component Type

**Page component:**

| Test | Tier |
|------|------|
| Renders without crash | T2 |
| Shows loading state | T2 |
| Shows error state | T2 |
| Shows data when loaded | T2 |
| Navigation/routing works | T3 |

**Feature component (with business logic):**

| Test | Tier |
|------|------|
| Happy path user interaction | T2 |
| Form validation errors shown | T2 |
| Submit calls correct API with correct data | T2 |
| Error handling (API failure) | T2 |
| Edge cases (empty state, boundary values) | T3 |

**UI component (presentational):**

| Test | Tier |
|------|------|
| Renders with required props | T3 |
| Conditional rendering based on props | T3 |
| Snapshot test ONLY if visually critical | T3 |

**Custom hook:**

| Test | Tier |
|------|------|
| Happy path return values | T2 |
| Error states | T2 |
| Cleanup on unmount | T2 |

### What NOT to Test (Frontend)

- Styling / CSS classes applied (brittle, low value)
- Third-party library internals (React Router navigation, UI library rendering)
- Implementation details (internal state values, private methods)
- Static text content (unless contractual/legal)
- Every prop combination exhaustively

### Test Quality Rules (Frontend)

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Test user behavior, not implementation (`getByRole` > `getByTestId` > `querySelector`) | T2 |
| `getByTestId` only as last resort, prefer accessible queries | T3 |
| NEVER test internal state directly (test what the user sees) | T2 |
| Async operations: use `waitFor` / `findBy`, NEVER arbitrary `setTimeout` | T2 |
| Mock API layer, never mock React hooks directly (except `useNavigate` or similar) | T2 |
| Each test independent (no shared mutable state between tests) | T2 |
| `cleanup` between tests (automatic in most frameworks, verify if custom render) | T2 |

---

## 28. CSS / Styling

### Decision (project-level, choose ONE)

| Option | When to pick |
|--------|-------------|
| Tailwind CSS | Rapid development, utility-first, team prefers no CSS files |
| CSS Modules | Scoped styles, team prefers traditional CSS, no utility framework |
| Styled Components / CSS-in-JS | Dynamic styles based on props, theme-heavy apps |

IF project has no decision yet THEN choose before writing first component. NEVER mix approaches.

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| ONE styling approach per project. No mixing. | T2 |
| NEVER inline `style={{}}` except truly dynamic computed values (e.g., `width` from data) | T2 |
| NEVER `!important` without documented justification | T2 |
| Magic numbers in spacing/sizing: use design tokens or scale (4px, 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px) | T3 |
| Color values ALWAYS from design tokens / theme / variables. NEVER hardcoded hex inline. | T2 |
| Z-index values from defined scale (constants), never arbitrary numbers | T2 |

### Responsive

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Mobile-first approach (base styles = mobile, then breakpoints up) | T3 |
| Breakpoints from project constants, never magic numbers | T3 |
| NEVER hide critical content/functionality on mobile (only reflow) | T2 |
| Touch targets minimum 44x44px on interactive elements | T3 |

### File Organization

```
IF using CSS Modules THEN one `.module.css` per component, co-located
IF using Tailwind THEN no separate CSS files (classes in JSX)
IF using Styled Components THEN styles in same file if <50 LOC, separate `.styles.ts` if more
IF global styles needed THEN single `global.css` at root, nothing else global
```

---

## 29. Frontend File Structure

### Directory Convention

```
src/
├── pages/           # Route-level components (one per route)
├── components/      # Shared/reusable components
│   ├── ui/          # Pure presentational (Button, Input, Modal, Card)
│   └── features/    # Business-logic components (UserForm, DataTable)
├── hooks/           # Custom hooks
├── services/        # API client, fetchers, external integrations
├── utils/           # Pure functions, formatters, helpers
├── types/           # Shared TypeScript types/interfaces

├── assets/          # Images, fonts, icons (static)
└── styles/          # Global styles, theme, design tokens
```

### Rules

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Co-locate component + test + types + styles in same directory when component-specific | T3 |
| Shared types in `types/`, component-specific types in component directory | T3 |
| NEVER import from `pages/` in `components/` (pages import components, not the reverse) | T2 |
| NEVER circular imports between directories | T2 |
| `index.ts` barrel exports ONLY at directory level for public API, not for every subdirectory | T3 |
| Assets referenced by import (bundler-handled), NEVER relative path strings | T3 |

```
IF component used in 1 page only THEN keep in that page's directory
IF component used in 2+ pages THEN move to components/
IF hook used in 1 component only THEN keep in component file
IF hook used in 2+ components THEN move to hooks/
IF utility used in 1 file only THEN keep in that file
IF utility used in 3+ files THEN move to utils/
```

---

## 30. TypeScript Strict Config & Type Safety

### Mandatory tsconfig Rules

| Option | Value | Tier if wrong |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| `strict` | `true` | T2 |
| `noImplicitAny` | `true` (implied by strict) | T2 |
| `strictNullChecks` | `true` (implied by strict) | T1 (causes runtime crashes) |
| `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` | `true` | T2 |
| `noImplicitReturns` | `true` | T2 |
| `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` | `true` | T2 |
| `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames` | `true` | T3 |
| `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` | `true` | T3 |

IF `strict: false` in tsconfig THEN finding T2. No exceptions.

### Type Safety Rules

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| `any` forbidden without justification comment explaining why | T2 |
| `unknown` preferred over `any` for values of uncertain type | T2 |
| Type assertions (`as Type`) must have type guard or validation before | T2 |
| Non-null assertion (`!`) must have justification comment | T2 |
| `// @ts-ignore` must have reason comment. Prefer `// @ts-expect-error` with description. | T2 |
| NEVER `as any` to silence errors -- fix the type | T2 |
| API response types must match backend contract (shared types or code generation) | T2 |

### Pattern Rules

```
IF value can be null/undefined THEN use narrowing (if check), not assertion (!)
IF function returns different shapes THEN use discriminated union with literal type field
IF object has optional properties THEN use Partial<T> or explicit optionals, not `| undefined` on every field
IF casting is needed THEN use type guard function (returns `x is Type`), not bare `as`
IF generic has no constraint THEN add `extends` to constrain it
```

### Discriminated Unions (mandatory pattern for variant types)

```typescript
// CORRECT: discriminated union
type Result =
  | { status: 'ok'; data: User }
  | { status: 'error'; message: string };

// INCORRECT: optional fields guessing game
type Result = {
  status: string;
  data?: User;
  message?: string;
};
```

IF type represents 2+ variants THEN use discriminated union (T2).

---

## 31. Async Patterns

### Concurrency

```
IF operations are independent THEN Promise.all (parallel)
IF operations depend on each other THEN sequential await
IF operations are independent but should not overwhelm target THEN Promise.allSettled or batched
IF one failure should NOT cancel others THEN Promise.allSettled
IF one failure SHOULD cancel all THEN Promise.all
```

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| NEVER `await` in a loop when iterations are independent (use `Promise.all`) | T2 |
| NEVER fire-and-forget promises (no `await`, no `.catch`) | T1 |
| NEVER `async` function that never `await`s (remove `async`) | T3 |
| Unhandled rejection must crash process in Node.js (default in Node 22+) | T2 |

### Error Handling in Async

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Every `Promise.all` inside try/catch or `.catch` | T2 |
| Errors in `.catch` must be re-thrown or logged (never silently swallowed) | T2 |
| `finally` for cleanup (close connections, release locks) | T2 |

### Retry Pattern

```typescript
// Standard retry for transient failures
async function withRetry<T>(
  fn: () => Promise<T>,
  maxRetries: number = 3,
  delayMs: number = 1000,
): Promise<T> {
  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await fn();
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries) throw error;
      await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, delayMs * attempt)); // linear backoff
    }
  }
  throw new Error('Unreachable');
}
```

```
IF external API call THEN consider retry with backoff (T3)
IF database write THEN NEVER auto-retry (idempotency risk) (T1)
IF retry logic exists THEN must have max retries cap (T2)
IF retry delay THEN use backoff (linear or exponential), not fixed (T3)
```

### AbortController (Frontend)

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| API calls in useEffect must use AbortController | T2 |
| Abort on component unmount (cleanup return in useEffect) | T2 |
| AbortError must be caught and silently ignored (not shown to user) | T2 |

---

## 32. API Response Contract & Pagination

### Success Response Contract

Every successful API response follows this shape:

```typescript
interface ApiSuccessResponse<T> {
  status: 'ok';
  data: T;
  meta?: {
    pagination?: PaginationMeta;
    timing?: { durationMs: number };
    [key: string]: unknown;
  };
  requestId: string;
}
```

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| All endpoints return `{ status: 'ok', data, requestId }` | T2 |
| NEVER return raw array at root level (always wrapped in `data`) | T2 |
| NEVER return raw object without `status` field | T2 |
| `data` is the resource (object for single, array for list) | T2 |
| `meta` for non-resource info (pagination, timing) | T3 |
| Empty results: `{ status: 'ok', data: [], meta: { pagination: { total: 0 } } }` NOT 404 | T2 |

### Pagination

```
IF endpoint returns list THEN must support pagination (T2)
IF dataset can exceed 100 items THEN pagination is mandatory (T2)
IF dataset is append-only or time-ordered THEN cursor-based pagination
IF dataset needs random page access THEN offset-based pagination
IF uncertain THEN offset-based (simpler, good enough for <100k rows)
```

**Offset-based:**

```typescript
interface PaginationMeta {
  page: number;       // current page (1-based)
  pageSize: number;   // items per page
  total: number;      // total items
  totalPages: number; // ceil(total / pageSize)
}
```

**Cursor-based:**

```typescript
interface CursorPaginationMeta {
  cursor: string | null;  // opaque cursor for next page, null if last page
  hasMore: boolean;
  pageSize: number;
}
```

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Default page size defined in constant (not magic number) | T2 |
| Max page size enforced server-side (user cannot request 10000 items) | T2 |
| Page size validated with Zod (min 1, max MAX_PAGE_SIZE) | T2 |
| `page` parameter 1-based (not 0-based) for offset pagination | T3 |
| Cursor must be opaque (encoded), never expose raw DB IDs | T2 |

## 33. Concurrency & Idempotency

### Idempotency

```
IF endpoint is POST creating a resource THEN support idempotency key header (T2)
IF endpoint is PUT/PATCH THEN naturally idempotent (same input = same result) (T2)
IF endpoint is DELETE THEN return 200/204 even if already deleted (not 404) (T2)
IF payment/transfer/critical mutation THEN idempotency key is mandatory (T1)
```

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Idempotency key header: `Idempotency-Key` | T2 |
| Store key + response in cache (Redis) for replay window (24h default) | T2 |
| Duplicate request within window returns cached response (no re-execution) | T2 |
| NEVER rely on client to prevent double submit -- server must be safe | T2 |

### Optimistic Locking

```
IF resource can be edited by multiple users THEN optimistic locking (T2)
IF concurrent writes can corrupt data THEN optimistic locking is mandatory (T1)
```

Pattern: `updatedAt` or `version` column.

```typescript
// In UPDATE query:
// WHERE id = $1 AND updated_at = $2
// If 0 rows affected → ConflictError (409)
```

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Concurrent-editable resources must have `updated_at` or `version` column | T2 |
| UPDATE must include version check in WHERE clause | T2 |
| 0 rows affected = ConflictError (409), not silent success | T2 |
| NEVER use SELECT-then-UPDATE without locking (race condition) | T1 |

### Transaction Isolation

| Level | When to use |
|-------|------------|
| `READ COMMITTED` (PostgreSQL default) | Most operations. Default. |
| `REPEATABLE READ` | Reports, aggregations that need consistent snapshot |
| `SERIALIZABLE` | Financial operations, inventory decrements |

```
IF standard CRUD THEN READ COMMITTED (default, no action needed)
IF read-then-write pattern (check balance then deduct) THEN SERIALIZABLE or SELECT FOR UPDATE
IF report/export that must not see partial writes THEN REPEATABLE READ
```

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| NEVER assume default isolation is safe for financial/inventory operations | T1 |
| Explicit `SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL` when non-default needed | T2 |
| Transactions must be as short as possible (no external API calls inside transaction) | T2 |
| Deadlock handling: catch and retry (max 3 attempts) | T2 |

## 34. Producer↔Consumer Data Integrity (Anti-Fixture-Fabrication)

Origin: a production incident where 6 independent review passes gave unanimous approval on code that shipped ~2 weeks of undetected bugs. Root cause: every check validated against the same hand-typed fixture instead of the real system — the fixture and the bug agreed with each other, so agreement proved nothing. This section closes that failure at four independent checkpoints (Dante, Cerberus, Moriarty, Yoda) so a fabricated fixture can no longer satisfy all four by accident. It is enforced by checklists and gates, not yet by a CI script — treat it as structurally hard to skip, not mechanically impossible to skip.

Applies ONLY where a producer↔consumer seam exists (network call, DB read/write, file written and later reread, IPC, queue publish, HTTP response). IF the code has no such seam (pure function, stateless utility, library with no I/O) THEN this section does not apply — the unit test IS the round-trip.

### 34.1 Seam Classification

```
IF the changed code or its callees import/call a DB client, network client, or write a file that is read back later
  THEN a seam exists — this section applies, no exceptions
IF no such import/call exists anywhere in the changed files or their callees
  THEN "no seam" MAY be claimed
```

IF "no seam" is claimed THEN it must be backed by the grep/dependency check above, stated with the exact check run and its empty result — never by an agent's unaided assertion. Two agents asserting "no seam" is not stronger than one; neither replaces the mechanical check.

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Seam presence assumed by default (fail-closed) | T1 |
| "No seam" claimed without the mechanical check shown | T1 |
| Round-trip check present for a real seam | T1 |

### 34.2 Data Provenance

```
IF a value is used as "expected" in an assertion against real system behavior
  THEN it MUST be either:
    (a) a value this same test run just wrote, re-read through the real seam, or
    (b) derived from a contract/schema that neither the implementer nor the test author can edit to fit today's behavior
IF neither (a) nor (b) THEN the value is fabricated ground truth — T1 finding, regardless of where it was copied from
```

Capturing a "real" response once and hand-writing it into a fixture file is fabrication the moment that response goes stale relative to the run using it — treat any persisted literal expected-value as fabricated by default. Round-trip assertions are regenerated live, every run, against the real dependency (or a disposable real instance of it in CI). Only the check's logic persists as an artifact — never the captured values.

| Rule | Tier |
|------|------|
| Hand-typed literal used as expected value in a producer↔consumer test | T1 |
| Persisted/committed captured response reused across runs as a fixture | T1 |
| Expected value not traceable to this run's write or to an independent contract | T1 |

### 34.3 Round-Trip Completeness

```
IF a test writes a payload with N fields
  THEN the re-read assertion checks all N fields, enumerated programmatically from the write payload's keys (iterate the object, never a manual list) — a subset hand-picked or hand-typed by the test author does not satisfy this
IF the test asserts only some of the fields that were written
  THEN any field NOT asserted is an unverified seam — T2 finding, T1 if it is the field the feature is about
```

A round-trip that writes 8 fields and asserts on 1 caught nothing about the other 7.

### 34.4 Closed Checklist — Producer↔Consumer Gate

- [ ] Seam classification stated, with the mechanical check shown if "no seam" is claimed
- [ ] Every expected value traces to this run's write or to an independent contract — none hand-typed against "what the backend returns"
- [ ] Round-trip assertion covers every field in the write payload, not a hand-picked subset
- [ ] No persisted/committed fixture value reused across runs — captured data is regenerated live
- [ ] A sabotage attempt exists against the real dependency (Moriarty's Round-Trip Sabotage mandate) and the check went red
- [ ] The sabotage effect was confirmed through a channel independent of the path under test

IF any item is unchecked THEN the feature does not satisfy this section. Report which item and why — do not mark "done".
