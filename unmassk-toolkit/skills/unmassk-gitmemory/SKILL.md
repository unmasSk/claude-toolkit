# Git Memory — Core

Git is the memory. Every commit is resumable. Claude handles git — the user focuses on work.

## Mandatory: read CALIBRATION.md before doing anything

The file `CALIBRATION.md` next to this SKILL.md contains the memory calibration rules — when to save, which type to use, what not to save, how to detect signals. **It is mandatory reading.** Without it, you will make the same mistakes as always: losing corrections, confusing types, saving noise. Read it now.

## Rules

1. Never commit code to `main` directly **in a gitflow repo** — feature branch + PR; in a trunk/solo repo `main` is the working branch (see Safety → Repo type)
2. Never commit without trailers (hooks enforce it for Claude; humans get warnings only)
3. `context()`, `decision()`, `memo()`, `remember()` always use `--allow-empty`
4. If conflict/risky op → stop (see Safety section below)
5. Claude writes trailers automatically — never ask the user to write them

## Two Modes: Capture vs Safety

This skill has two distinct behaviors. They are NOT contradictory — they apply to different situations:

**Capture mode** (memory commits) → **silent, automatic, no confirmation**:

- `wip:` — silent checkpoint
- `decision()` — architecture choice detected → commit immediately, inform in one line
- `memo()` — preference/requirement detected → commit immediately, inform in one line
- `remember()` — personality note → commit immediately, inform in one line

**Safety mode** (dangerous git ops) → **always confirm before acting**:

- `squash` / `reset --soft HEAD~N` — show what will be squashed, wait for "ok"
- `context()` — show the message, wait for "ok"
- `reset --hard` — show what will be lost, require explicit confirmation
- `push --force` — feature branches only, require explicit confirmation
- `rebase` — require explicit "I understand the risk"

Capture never asks. Safety always asks. No exceptions.

## Memory Policy

> "Write little, read often, confirm when it hurts to be wrong."

Write ONLY if: user asked explicitly, affects future sessions, prevents real loss, or is a confirmed decision.
Do NOT write: provisional observations, weak inferences, session-only context.

## Boot Protocol

The `[git-memory-boot]` SessionStart hook provides ALL context pre-extracted: STATUS, BRANCH, RESUME, REMEMBER, DECISIONS, MEMOS, TIMELINE, and script paths. Claude does NOT need to run doctor or git-memory-log on boot — everything is already in context.

On boot, Claude only needs to:

1. Load this skill (Skill tool call)
2. Read the SessionStart output already in context
3. Show a summary to the user

## Wrapper Scripts

**NEVER use `git commit` or `git log` directly.** A PreToolUse hook will BLOCK them.

The boot output terminator provides the plugin root path. Use it:

**For commits**: `python3 <plugin-root>/bin/git-memory-commit.py <type> <scope> <message> [--body TEXT] [--trailer KEY=VALUE]... [--push]`

**For logs**: `python3 <plugin-root>/bin/git-memory-log.py [N] [--all] [--type TYPE]`

## Hierarchical Scopes

Use **hierarchical scopes** separated by `/` in commit subjects. Max 2 levels deep.

Examples:

- `feat(backend/api): add rate limiting`
- `decision(frontend/ux): usar glassmorphic style`
- `memo(backend/auth): preference - JWT over sessions`

**Scope map:** read `.claude/git-memory-scopes.json` or `.claude/agent-memory/unmassk-crew-bilbo/scopes.json` if it exists. To generate or update scopes, launch Bilbo (`subagent_type=unmassk-toolkit:bilbo`) to analyze the project structure and write the JSON to `.claude/agent-memory/unmassk-crew-bilbo/scopes.json`. You can use unlisted scopes — the map is a guide, not a constraint.

## Trailer Spec

Every non-wip commit. Trailers at end of body, contiguous block, no blank lines between them.

## Auto-Git Triggers

| Situation                               | Action                                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Code changes + stop hook fires          | `wip:` silent auto-commit (NEVER ask the user)                  |
| 3+ consecutive wips accumulated         | Evaluate: suggest squash or proper commit at natural milestones |
| Task complete                           | Squash WIPs + final commit + merge to dev                       |
| "I'm done" / "tomorrow"                 | `context()` with Next/Blocker                                   |
| Design choice made                      | `decision()`                                                    |
| Preference/requirement stated           | `memo()`                                                        |
| "remember that I..." / personality note | `remember()`                                                    |
| Claude notices working-style pattern    | `remember(claude)` — sparingly                                  |
| Dev advanced                            | Merge dev into current branch                                   |

## Next <-> Issues

Next: trailers auto-create GitHub issues via git-memory-commit.py.
Format: `Next: description #issue-number`
The commit script handles issue creation — Claude doesn't need to call gh manually.
Resolved-Next: trailers auto-close the referenced issue.
For advanced issue management (milestones, templates, checklists) use `gh issue` commands directly.

## Wip Strategy

wip commits are silent checkpoints. The stop hook creates them automatically when it detects uncommitted changes. Rules:

- Use descriptive subjects: `wip: refactor auth middleware` not just `wip`
- Never ask the user before creating a wip — they are noise-free by design
- After 3+ consecutive wips, the stop hook suggests a checkpoint. Evaluate with judgement:
  - If you just completed a feature/fix/refactor → suggest squashing into a real commit with trailers
  - If the user is mid-flow → let the wips accumulate, don't interrupt
  - Squashing means: `git reset --soft HEAD~N` + proper commit with Why/Touched/etc. trailers
- wip commits NEVER have trailers. They are temporary by definition.

## Conversational Capture

A `UserPromptSubmit` hook fires on EVERY user message and injects a `[memory-check]` reminder. When you see it, evaluate the user's message:

**Decision signals** → `decision()` immediately:

- "let's go with X", "decided", "we'll use Y", "go with Z"
- "the approach is X", "final answer: Y"

**Memo signals** → `memo()` with category:

- "always X" / "never Y" / "from now on" → `memo(preference)`
- "client wants X" / "it must" / "mandatory" → `memo(requirement)`
- "don't ever do X again" / "that broke because" → `memo(antipattern)`

**Remember signals** → `remember()` personality/working-style notes:

- "remember that I X", "recuerda que yo X", "don't forget I X" → `remember(user)`
- If the content is about the project ("remember we decided X") → use `decision()` instead
- If the content is about a project preference ("remember to always use X") → use `memo()` instead
- Default to `remember()` when it's about the person, not the project

**Claude-initiated remembers** → `remember(claude)`:

- ONLY after seeing the **same pattern at least 2 times** in the current session
- ONLY for patterns that caused friction or miscommunication (e.g., you assumed something and the user corrected you twice)
- NEVER from a single observation. One correction is feedback, not a pattern.
- Examples that warrant it: "user corrected me 3 times for assuming X", "user always responds in Spanish even when I write in English"
- Examples that do NOT: "user seems tired today", "user typed fast", "user used an emoji once"

**Two distinct paths** (so this does not contradict CALIBRATION's "first correction counts"):

- **Explicit user correction** of a durable thing (stable fact / declared-permanent preference) → save on the 1st (per CALIBRATION).
- **Claude's own pattern observation** (no explicit correction) → needs 2+ occurrences. One self-noticed instance is feedback, not a pattern.
- Either path: NEVER a systemic or project-scoped rule — those go to the loaded skill / memo / decision, not a global remember(claude).

**Not memory-worthy** (ignore silently):

- Questions, brainstorming, "what if", "maybe", "let's explore"
- Temporary debugging, one-off instructions
- Already captured in an existing decision/memo/remember

**When detected**:

1. Create the commit immediately with `--allow-empty`
2. Inform the user in ONE line: "📌 memo saved: ..." or "🧭 decision saved: ..." or "🧠 remember saved: ..."
3. Do NOT ask for confirmation. Do NOT propose. Just do it.

**Uncertain cases**: if the user clearly made a statement but you're unsure whether it's a decision, memo, or remember — pick the closest type and commit. Miscategorized > lost. But if you can't tell whether the user is stating something or just thinking out loud — **don't commit**. When in doubt about intent, silence beats noise.

## Memory Search (before asking the user)

1. `git log --all --grep="Decision:" --pretty=format:"%h %s %b" | grep -i "<keyword>"`
2. `git log --all --grep="Memo:" --pretty=format:"%h %s %b" | grep -i "<keyword>"`
3. `git log --all --grep="Remember:" --pretty=format:"%h %s %b" | grep -i "<keyword>"`
4. Check CLAUDE.md and `~/.claude/MEMORY.md`
5. Only if no match: ask the user

**Contradiction detection**: before creating decision/memo, search same scope. Warn if conflict exists. Most recent always wins.

## Protocol

### Authority Hierarchy

1. User instruction in conversation (highest)
2. Confirmed memory (decisions/memos with commit)
3. CLAUDE.md of the project
4. Other context files (.cursorrules, docs)
5. Code inferences (lowest)

If conflict between sources: acknowledge openly, defer to most recent user confirmation.

### Noise Levels

| Level         | When                                         | Action                            |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **silent**    | All OK                                       | Zero output                       |
| **inline**    | Warning, not blocking                        | Mention only if asked or relevant |
| **interrupt** | Capacity loss (hooks broken, runtime absent) | Warn before working               |

### Confidence Levels

| Level      | Example               | Action                                  |
| ---------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Fact       | "Uses TypeScript 5.3" | `memo(stack)` — commit immediately      |
| Decision   | "let's go with dayjs" | `decision()` — commit immediately       |
| Preference | "Always async/await"  | `memo(preference)` — commit immediately |
| Hypothesis | "Seems like monorepo" | Do NOT save. Investigate first.         |

## Safety

### Repo type (decides whether `main` is protected)

**`main` is protected by DEFAULT. A repo is treated as trunk ONLY when explicitly declared so — never inferred from what the repo happens to contain.**

**1. Marker first (primary mechanism).** Read `.claude/git-memory-config.json` → `repo_type` (`trunk` | `gitflow`). If present, use it — done. Every repo carries this marker; set it once.

**2. No marker → fail-closed to gitflow.** Without a marker you do NOT have enough to call it trunk. Treat it as **gitflow** (protected); ask the user to declare the type, then write the marker. Detection signals only *raise suspicion*, never *conclude trunk*:
- **Any auto-deploy hosting integration (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, …) → gitflow** — even if the deploy config lives OUTSIDE the repo (Vercel↔GitHub is wired in the dashboard, not a repo file). "No CI visible in the repo" is NOT evidence of trunk; it's the absence of one signal.
- A `dev`/`staging` branch, or CI/CD triggered on `main` → gitflow.
- Absence of all internal signals → **suspicion, not conclusion** → fail-closed to gitflow until confirmed.

**The defining test** (used to *declare* the marker, not to guess from contents): *does a commit to `main` here, by itself, auto-deploy/publish to users (CD)?* Yes → gitflow. No → trunk. Criterion is auto-deploy **on the commit**, not "is it ever published": a repo that releases via a separate deliberate step (version bump, marketplace publish, manual deploy) is **trunk** — the commit ships nothing by itself.

**Behavior by type:**
- **gitflow** → `main` protected. Code in `feat/*`, merged via PR. NEVER commit code to `main` directly. (Merging the PR is the deliberate, reviewed production deploy.)
- **trunk** → `main` IS the working branch (memory repos, toolkits, notes, solo projects). Commit directly to `main`.

**Invariants, regardless of type:**
- **Force-push to `main` is FORBIDDEN in BOTH** — history integrity (rewriting/losing commits), unrelated to deployment.
- **Memory commits** (`decision`/`memo`/`remember`/`context`, `--allow-empty`) go to the **current branch**, always allowed — they never deploy.

**Enforcement (prerequisite, not "someday").** Until a PreToolUse gate blocks direct `main` commits in gitflow repos, this protection is doc-only — text the agent must remember, unreliable for a real production repo. The gate is a **prerequisite before working ANY gitflow repo with commits** (e.g. Korven), not a comfortable follow-up.

### Branches

**Gitflow repos:** base `dev`; work in `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`; **1 issue = 1 branch**; default merge (not rebase); PR to merge into `main`.
**Trunk repos:** work directly on `main`; branches and PRs are optional, not required; "1 issue = 1 branch" does NOT apply.

### Conflict Resolution

- Default: merge, not rebase. If conflict: **stop**, don't improvise.
- Resolution commits MUST include: `Conflict:` + `Resolution:` + `Why:` + `Touched:` + `Risk:`
- Force push to `main`: **FORBIDDEN** (every repo type — history safety, independent of deployment).
- Force push to `staging`: only with explicit approval + documented reason + `Risk: high`.
- Rebase: only with explicit user request and risk acceptance.

### Undo Operations

| Operation                   | Risk          | Confirm?                           |
| --------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `reset --soft HEAD~1`       | low           | No                                 |
| `stash push/pop`            | low           | No                                 |
| `revert <sha>`              | low           | No (creates new commit)            |
| `amend` (before push)       | low           | No                                 |
| `amend` (after push)        | **high**      | YES                                |
| `reset --hard`              | **high**      | YES — show what will be lost first |
| `push --force-with-lease`   | **high**      | YES — feature branches only        |
| `push --force` main/staging | **FORBIDDEN** | N/A                                |

Any `rebase`, `push --force`, `reset --hard` → **STOP**. Use this confirmation format:

```
⚠️ DANGEROUS OPERATION: <command>
Branch: <branch-name>
Risk: <high>

This can cause:
- <consequence 1>
- <consequence 2>

Type "I understand the risk, proceed" to continue.
```

### Merge Rules

- **Always `--no-ff`** when merging to dev: `git merge --no-ff <branch>`. This preserves the branch history and creates a merge commit that hooks can detect.
- **Pre-merge checklist** (before any merge to dev):
  1. Run lint/format/tests if the project has them
  2. Verify no debug code left (`console.log`, `dd`, `dump`)
  3. Check for uncommitted changes on target branch

### Releases

- (Gitflow repos) PR mandatory: `dev → staging`. Production: `staging → main` with release protocol. (Trunk repos release from `main` via their own deliberate step — version bump/publish.)
- No `Next:` on main commits. `Risk:` always required on hotfixes.
- PR body auto-generated from trailers.
- Hotfix flow: branch from main → fix → PR to main → **back-merge to dev IMMEDIATELY** (same session, no delay). If you skip this, the bug reappears next time dev merges to staging.

## Issues & Milestones

GitHub Issues as **shared memory** — nothing is lost between sessions, subagents work without previous context, the repo has full traceability.

### Issue Rules

1. 1 issue = 1 unit of work. No vague issues.
2. Every issue MUST include: context + checklist + DoD + how to validate. Use the template in `TEMPLATE.md`.
3. If you detect improvements while working on something else → **create issue, DON'T fix it** (unless critical/security)
4. Before creating: search existing issues to avoid duplicates (`gh issue list --state open`)
5. Claude creates issues from conversation — the user never has to go to GitHub manually

### When to Create Issues

**User triggers:**

- "note this", "create issue", "do this later", "add to backlog"
- "we need to...", "eventually we should..."
- "this is a bug", "found a bug"

**Claude-detected (propose before creating):**

- Bug or improvement spotted while working on something else
- Technical debt identified during code review
- Security vulnerability found

For Claude-detected issues: propose in one line, create if user confirms. Don't interrupt flow.

### Milestones

Milestones group related issues into a body of work:

```bash
# Create milestone
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones -f title="Audit backend" -f description="Enterprise audit of all backend modules" -f due_on="2026-04-01T00:00:00Z"

# Create issue linked to milestone
gh issue create --title "[REFACTOR] Split user.service.ts" --body-file ... --milestone "Audit backend"
```

**When to suggest milestones:**

- User mentions a multi-issue initiative ("audit backend", "migrate to v2", "redesign auth")
- 3+ related issues share a common goal

### Issue Lifecycle

```
User describes work → Claude creates issue with template
        ↓
Claude creates branch: feat/issue-42-slug (or fix/issue-42-slug)
        ↓
During work: wip commits reference the issue
        ↓
Checklist items update as work progresses
        ↓
Merge to dev → issue auto-closes (Closes #42 in commit)
```

### Branch Linking

Branch naming:

- `feat/issue-42-<slug>` for features/enhancements
- `fix/issue-42-<slug>` for bugs
- `chore/issue-42-<slug>` for refactors/tech-debt

The `Issue:` trailer in commits links back: `Issue: #42`

### GH Commands Reference

```bash
# Create issue
gh issue create --title "<title>" --body "<body>" --label "<labels>" [--milestone "<name>"]

# List open issues
gh issue list --state open [--milestone "<name>"] [--label "<label>"]

# View / Close issue
gh issue view <number>
gh issue close <number> --comment "Completed and merged to dev"

# Create / List milestones
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones -f title="<name>" -f description="<desc>"
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones --jq '.[].title'
```

### Issue Confirmation Rules

- **Always confirm** before: closing an issue, labeling as urgent, creating a milestone
- **Never confirm** for: creating a standard issue, updating checklist, adding labels

## Recovery

### Self-Healing (rebase/reset detection)

On boot, compare known commit hashes with current tree. If amnesia detected (memory commits missing):

> "Seems like a rebase happened. I've rebuilt memory from current state, but prior design context may be missing."

Don't dramatize. Don't fake normalcy. Rebuild conservatively, be honest about gaps.

### Force Push Handling

- Detect history rewrite (known SHAs missing from tree)
- Don't assume "most recent = best"
- Conservative resolution — never invent missing context
- Log what was lost if detectable

### Branch-Aware Decisions

Decisions have scope: repo / branch / path / environment. Don't deduplicate across branches. Treat differing decisions on different branches as branch-specific context.

### Emergency: Lost Commits

```bash
git reflog                    # find SHA before the reset
git reset --hard <sha>        # recover (reflog keeps ~30 days)
```

Document recovery with `Risk: high` + `Why:` trailers. Create backup branch before any destructive recovery: `git branch backup-before-recovery`
