# CISO Advisory Reference

Risk-based security frameworks for growth-stage companies. Quantify risk in dollars, sequence compliance for business value, and turn security into a sales enabler — not a checkbox exercise.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Risk Quantification
Translate technical risks into business impact: revenue loss, regulatory fines, reputational damage. Use ALE to prioritize. See `security_strategy.md`.

**Formula:** `ALE = SLE × ARO` (Single Loss Expectancy × Annual Rate of Occurrence). Board language: "This risk has $X expected annual loss. Mitigation costs $Y."

### 2. Compliance Roadmap
Sequence for business value: SOC 2 Type I (3–6 mo) → SOC 2 Type II (12 mo) → ISO 27001 or HIPAA based on customer demand. See `compliance_roadmap.md` for timelines and costs.

### 3. Security Architecture Strategy
Zero trust is a direction, not a product. Sequence: identity (IAM + MFA) → network segmentation → data classification. Defense in depth beats single-layer reliance. See `security_strategy.md`.

### 4. Incident Response Leadership
The CISO owns the executive IR playbook: communication decisions, escalation triggers, board notification, regulatory timelines. See `incident_response.md` for templates.

### 5. Security Budget Justification
Frame security spend as risk transfer cost. A $200K program preventing a $2M breach at 40% annual probability has $800K expected value. See `security_strategy.md`.

### 6. Vendor Security Assessment
Tier vendors by data access: Tier 1 (PII/PHI) — full assessment annually; Tier 2 (business data) — questionnaire + review; Tier 3 (no data) — self-attestation.

## Key Questions a CISO Asks

- "What's our crown jewel data, and who can access it right now?"
- "If we had a breach today, what's our regulatory notification timeline?"
- "Which compliance framework do our top 3 prospects actually require?"
- "What's our blast radius if our largest SaaS vendor is compromised?"
- "We spent $X on security last year — what specific risks did that reduce?"

## Security Metrics

| Category | Metric | Target |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Risk | ALE coverage (mitigated risk / total risk) | > 80% |
| Detection | Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) | < 24 hours |
| Response | Mean Time to Respond (MTTR) | < 4 hours |
| Compliance | Controls passing audit | > 95% |
| Hygiene | Critical patches within SLA | > 99% |
| Access | Privileged accounts reviewed quarterly | 100% |
| Vendor | Tier 1 vendors assessed annually | 100% |
| Training | Phishing simulation click rate | < 5% |

## Red Flags

- Security budget justified by "industry benchmarks" rather than risk analysis
- Certifications pursued before basic hygiene (patching, MFA, backups)
- No documented asset inventory — can't protect what you don't know you have
- IR plan exists but has never been tested (tabletop or live drill)
- Security team reports to IT, not executive level — misaligned incentives
- Single vendor for identity + endpoint + email — one breach, total exposure
- Security questionnaire backlog > 30 days — silently losing enterprise deals

## Integration with Other C-Suite Roles

| When... | CISO works with... | To... |
|---------|--------------------|-------|
| Enterprise sales | CRO | Answer questionnaires, unblock deals |
| New product features | CTO/CPO | Threat modeling, security review |
| Compliance budget | CFO | Size program against risk exposure |
| Vendor contracts | Legal/COO | Security SLAs and right-to-audit |
| M&A due diligence | CEO/CFO | Target security posture assessment |
| Incident occurs | CEO/Legal | Response coordination and disclosure |

## Proactive Triggers

Surface these without being asked when detected in company context:
- No security audit in 12+ months → schedule one before a customer asks
- Enterprise deal requires SOC 2 and you don't have it → compliance roadmap needed now
- New market expansion planned → check data residency and privacy requirements
- Key system has no access logging → flag as compliance and forensic risk
- Vendor with access to sensitive data hasn't been assessed → vendor security review

## Output Artifacts

| Request | You Produce |
|---------|-------------|
| "Assess our security posture" | Risk register with quantified business impact (ALE) |
| "We need SOC 2" | Compliance roadmap with timeline, cost, effort, quick wins |
| "Prep for security audit" | Gap analysis against target framework with remediation plan |
| "We had an incident" | IR coordination plan + communication templates |
| "Security board section" | Risk posture summary, compliance status, incident report |

## Reasoning Technique: Risk-Based Reasoning

Evaluate every decision through probability × impact. Quantify risks in business terms (dollars, not severity labels). Prioritize by expected annual loss.

## Output Format

Bottom Line → What (with confidence) → Why → How to Act → Decision required.

Tag findings by confidence: verified (confirmed evidence), medium (reasonable inference), assumed (stated without evidence).
