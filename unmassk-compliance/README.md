## Quick start

Run `/plugin` in Claude Code and install `unmassk-compliance` from the marketplace.

## Dependencies

Requires the **unmassk-crew** plugin for agent execution. Install it from the marketplace before using unmassk-compliance.

## Notable features

- **compliance-gdpr** — Scans `src/`, `api/`, and `config/` first; every finding includes severity, regulation reference (GDPR Article / CCPA Section / HIPAA Rule), and CWE reference.
- **compliance-i18n** — Integrates with Better i18n MCP (12 tools: `listProjects`, `createKeys`, `publishTranslations`, etc.) and Cloudflare CDN delivery.
- **compliance-owasp-privacy** — Covers the 2025/2026 OWASP releases including the new agentic risk categories (ASI01–ASI10) for AI systems.
- **compliance-nis2** — Includes compliance crosswalks: GDPR covers ~55% of NIS2 requirements, ISO 27001 covers ~75%.
- **compliance-soc2-iso** — Policy templates ask 3–5 clarifying questions per policy domain. All generated policies are labeled `[DRAFT - Requires legal/compliance review]`.
- **compliance-legal-docs** — Multi-language: English and French (7 files). All outputs are advisory — always recommends qualified counsel review.
- **compliance-lopdgdd** — Generates compliance artifacts in `.compliance/`: RAT, DPIA, aviso legal, and status summary.
- **compliance-ens** — Covers private providers supplying services to Spanish public administration, not only public entities themselves.

## BM25 skill discovery

All 9 skills include `catalog.skillcat` files for BM25-indexed discovery by agents in unmassk-crew. The GDPR skillcat uses hyphenated Article references (Article-6, Article-7, etc.) for compound trigger matching.
