# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- All 10 agent prompts: replaced routing language (`flag to X`, `route to X`, `@mention`) with scope declarations (`X's scope`). Agents outside chatroom cannot invoke each other — they only report back to the orchestrator.
- Ultron: added missing "The Team" table, removed leftover v1-to-v2 meta sections ("Things Cut From v1", "Summary of Changes").
- Cerberus: completed "The Team" table (was missing House, Bilbo, Alexandria, Gitto).
- Removed chatroom V2 reference files (`chatroom/*-system-prompt-v2.md`) — V2 is now canonical only in plugin source (`unmassk-toolkit/agents/`).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `compliance-legal-docs` skill: SKILL.md created with 42-reference routing table organized by category (contract review, GDPR/privacy, risk assessment, litigation, French employment law, vendor due diligence, document processing, legal ops)
- V2 system prompts for all 10 agents (alexandria, argus, bilbo, cerberus, dante, gitto, house, moriarty, ultron, yoda): universal format with The Team table, EXHAUSTION PROTOCOL, plain agent names (no @mentions), and no chatroom references — prompts work in any Claude Code context. Each agent self-reviewed their V2 draft and restored load-bearing V1 content that the initial rewrite lost.
- 5-phase agent pipeline: `PIPELINE_GENERIC` and `AGENT_PIPELINE_POSITION` rewritten. Each agent has an explicit chain position entry covering role, when to act, and when to skip.

### Fixed
- Boot hook now skips tombstoned entries when merging glossary remembers and memos into the session summary — `Resolved-Remember:` and `Resolved-Memo:` tombstones are respected on the glossary merge path, not just on the recent-commits path.
- Mention parser now strips fenced and inline code blocks before regex matching — prevents phantom @mentions inside code samples from triggering agent invocations.
- `stoppedRooms` guard added in `agent-scheduler`, `agent-result`, and `ws-control-handlers` — prevents agent cascade after a stop command.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-16 (unmassk-crew)

### Added
- Cerberus commit-review mode: diff-only review pass with three severity tiers — Issue (blocks merge), Suggestion (recommended, non-blocking), Nitpick (never blocks). Includes a nitpick checklist covering naming conventions, natural language, import type consistency, `as const` usage, magic numbers, stray `console.log`, and similar low-stakes hygiene items. Inspired by CodeRabbit's review model.
- Alexandria merge mode: fast pre-merge documentation gate. Reads only the branch commits vs target branch, updates CHANGELOG under `[Unreleased]`, and checks affected CLAUDE.md files for staleness. No new files created, no memory writes — designed for speed at the merge boundary.
- `pre-merge-gate.py` PreToolUse hook: blocks `git merge` and `git pull` (non-rebase) commands until Cerberus and Alexandria have both passed. Detects `git.exe` on Windows, uses case-insensitive command matching, guards against `eval`/`bash -c`/`sh -c` indirection, and normalizes null bytes. Bypass by adding `# merge-reviewed` comment after both agents pass.

### Changed
- Orchestrator rules in `session-start-crew.py` updated with merge gate awareness: orchestrator must not call merge commands without a prior Cerberus + Alexandria pass, and proactive agent launch guidance is now explicit in the managed block.
- Crew table descriptions updated: Cerberus now documents both enterprise-audit mode and commit-review mode; Alexandria now documents both standard mode and merge mode.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-03-16 (unmassk-crew)

### Added
- `validate-memory-path.py` PreToolUse hook blocks agent-memory writes outside the git root — prevents agents from creating `.claude/agent-memory/` directories in wrong locations after `cd` operations. Fail-closed design with Windows case-insensitive path handling and symlink resolution via `realpath`.
- Orchestrator rules added to the `session-start-crew.py` managed block: orchestrator must not write code (delegate to Ultron), must launch Cerberus+Argus after any new code lands, decides what and who — not how.

### Changed
- Agent boot prompts hardened in 6 agents (cerberus, dante, ultron, alexandria, bilbo, house): `GIT_ROOT` is now resolved once as an absolute path with `|| exit 1` fallback, and the memory section enforces absolute paths anchored to `GIT_ROOT`.
- `hooks.json` updated with PreToolUse matcher for `Write|Edit` pointing to `validate-memory-path.py`.

### Fixed
- `compliance-legal-docs` references: removed broken `/mnt/skills/public/docx/SKILL.md` paths in 3 GDPR files (gdpr-privacy-notice-eu, dpia-sentinel, gdpr-breach-sentinel) — now points to `legal-docx-processing-anthropic`
- `compliance-legal-docs` references: removed broken sub-file references in both assignation-en-référé files (workflow-informations.md, structure-assignation.md, workflow-collecte.md, variantes-cas-particuliers.md, conseils-strategie.md) — workflows now self-contained in the reference files
- `compliance-legal-docs` references: removed broken `assets/` template path in politique-confidentialite-malik-taiar
- `compliance-legal-docs` references: removed `scripts/office/unpack.py`, `scripts/comment.py`, `scripts/accept_changes.py`, `scripts/recalc.py` references — replaced with standard system commands (unzip, LibreOffice, zip)
- `compliance-legal-docs` references: removed `editing.md`, `pptxgenjs.md`, `scripts/thumbnail.py` references from pptx-processing — replaced with inline instructions
- `compliance-legal-docs` references: removed `REFERENCE.md`, `FORMS.md` references from pdf-processing
- `compliance-legal-docs` references: replaced `AskUserQuestion`/`Task` tool calls in tabular-review with plain prose instructions; updated pdf/docx/xlsx "skill" references to reference file names

- `unmassk-ops` plugin: 5 skills covering the full ops domain (iac, containers, cicd, observability, scripting)
- `ops-iac` skill: SKILL.md + 14 references rewritten (Terraform, Ansible, Helm, Pulumi, OpenTofu)
- `ops-containers` skill: SKILL.md + 19 references rewritten (Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, container security)
- `ops-observability` skill: SKILL.md + 9 references rewritten (Prometheus, Grafana, alerting, logging)
- `ops-scripting` skill: SKILL.md + 21 references rewritten (Bash, Makefile)
- `ops-cicd` skill: SKILL.md + 30 references rewritten (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure Pipelines, Jenkins)

## [3.7.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Boot auto-detects missing `git-memory-scopes.json` and instructs Claude to generate it via Explore agent
- Next cleanup in boot: checks GitHub issue status for pending Next items — closed issues are filtered out, items older than 7 days without an issue ref are marked `[stale]`
- Cross-repo guard prevents false positives when Next items reference issues in other repositories
- GC tombstone support for `Resolved-Next:` trailers — resolved pending items are hidden from future boot output
- Context warnings now use debounce: same-level warnings suppressed for 5 messages (shows `[CTX: N%]` instead), severity escalation (warning to critical) bypasses debounce
- Advisory language for context warnings — informs the agent instead of commanding it
- Test coverage for `context-writer.py` statusline wrapper (7 tests)
- `CO_AUTHOR` is now configurable via `GIT_MEMORY_CO_AUTHOR` environment variable

### Changed
- Scout agent removed — scope scanning now handled by an Explore agent prompt during boot
- Context percentage is now always shown in the UserPromptSubmit hook output (previously only displayed at 60%+ usage)
- Removed `Refs:` trailer key from valid keys — was unused dead code
- Replaced remaining scout terminology in bootstrap script and tests

### Fixed
- Boot and commit script hardening from code review feedback
- Debounce oscillation bug: context bouncing between 59-61% caused stale debounce state to suppress warnings incorrectly — state now resets when context drops back to info level
- `.context-status.json` and `.context-warn-state.json` added to `.gitignore` (were being tracked as noise)

## [3.6.0] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Boot briefing v2: SessionStart hook produces structured output with zero redundant bash calls
- Automatic conversion of `Next:` trailers to GitHub issues during boot

### Changed
- Version is now centralized in `lib/version.py` as single source of truth, read from `plugin.json`
- CLAUDE.md boot instructions corrected and simplified

## [3.5.1] - 2026-03-13

### Added
- Context warnings now fire mid-session via UserPromptSubmit hook, not just at boot
- Slim hook output after boot — flag file prevents repeated instructions

### Fixed
- Quote all paths in hook output to prevent Windows path mangling

### Fixed
- Belt regex now catches `git -C` and other flags before `log`/`commit` interception

### Added
- `remember()` commit type for explicit long-term memory capture
