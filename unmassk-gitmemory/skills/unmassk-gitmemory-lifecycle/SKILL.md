# Git Memory — Lifecycle

**Rule: Claude executes all lifecycle commands. Never ask the user to run them.**
**Rule: ALWAYS pass `--auto` to every script. Never let scripts prompt for input.**

### Finding scripts

Scripts live in the plugin cache, NOT at the project root. The `[git-memory-boot]` hook output provides the plugin root path. Use it: `python3 <plugin-root>/bin/git-memory-<command>.py --auto`

**NEVER hardcode paths** like `python3 bin/...` — the project root has NO plugin files.

## Install (transactional)

```bash
python3 <plugin-root>/bin/git-memory-install.py --auto
```

The `--auto` flag skips all interactive prompts. **Always use it.**

The script runs 5 phases: inspect → plan → apply → verify → health proof.
It only writes CLAUDE.md and `.claude/.unmassk/manifest.json` to the project.
No files are copied to the project root — the plugin runs entirely from the cache.

## Doctor (diagnosis)

Check and report, one line per item:

```
Memory System Status
─────────────────────────
✅ Hooks: 6/6 in plugin cache
✅ Skills: 2/2 in plugin cache
✅ CLAUDE.md: managed block present
✅ Hook activity: 12/15 commits have trailers (80%)
✅ GC: last run 4 days ago
❌ Stale blockers: 2 items >30 days
✅ Version: v3.6.0 (current)
─────────────────────────
Recommendation: review stale blockers
```

Run silently by the SessionStart hook on every boot. STATUS section in boot output shows the result. Only report details to the user if problems found.

## Repair

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| CLAUDE.md block missing | Recreate managed block |
| Manifest missing/corrupt | Regenerate manifest |
| Old-style install files at root | Run install to clean up |
| Plugin cache broken | User must run `/plugin install` |

## Uninstall

| Mode | Removes | Keeps |
|------|---------|-------|
| **safe** (default) | CLAUDE.md block, manifest | Git history |
| **full-local** | Above + generated files | Git history |

Git history (commits with trailers) is **never deleted automatically**.
To remove the plugin itself: `/plugin uninstall unmassk-gitmemory`

## Manifest (.claude/.unmassk/manifest.json)

```json
{
  "version": "3.6.0",
  "installed_at": "ISO8601",
  "runtime_mode": "normal|compatible|read-only",
  "managed_blocks": [
    { "file": "CLAUDE.md", "begin": "BEGIN unmassk-gitmemory", "end": "END unmassk-gitmemory" }
  ],
  "hook_registrations": ["PreToolUse", "PostToolUse", "Stop", "PreCompact", "SessionStart", "UserPromptSubmit"],
  "last_healthcheck_at": "ISO8601"
}
```

## Maintenance: Opportunistic

No scheduled calendar. Claude cleans in passing (never asks user to run commands):

| When | What | Claude does |
|------|------|-------------|
| Session start | STATUS in boot output | SessionStart hook runs doctor silently → shows result in STATUS section |
| PR/merge | Clean stale trailers if seen | "Cleaned 2 stale items in passing" |
| Symptoms detected | GC on demand | Ask user "Clean up?" → run GC from plugin cache |
| User asks | Full GC | Run GC (Claude runs it, shows results) |

Never interrupt the user with unsolicited admin tasks. Never ask the user to run commands.

## Modes of Operation

| Mode | When | Does | Doesn't |
|------|------|------|---------|
| **Normal** | Standard git repo | Full runtime: hooks + trailers + CLI | — |
| **Compatible** | CI/commitlint rejects trailers | git notes or local store instead | Touch commit messages |
| **Read-only** | No write perms, external repo | Read existing memory | Create commits |
| **Abort** | No git | Explain why and stop | Force anything |

Detected during install inspection. Stored in manifest. If uncertain, ask.

### CI Compatibility

Check compatibility BEFORE activating writes. If commitlint is active, use compatible mode or allowed namespace. Alternative: git notes for local memory.

## Recovery

### Self-Healing (rebase/reset detection)

On boot, compare known commit hashes with current tree. If amnesia detected (memory commits missing):

> "Seems like a rebase happened. I've rebuilt memory from current state, but prior design context may be missing."

Don't dramatize. Don't fake normalcy. Rebuild conservatively, be honest about gaps.

### Force Push Handling

- Detect history rewrite (known SHAs missing from tree)
- Don't assume "most recent = best"
- Conservative resolution — never invent missing context
- Log what was lost if detectable

### Branch-Aware Decisions

Decisions have scope: repo / branch / path / environment. Don't deduplicate across branches. Treat differing decisions on different branches as branch-specific context.

### Emergency: Lost Commits

```bash
git reflog                    # find SHA before the reset
git reset --hard <sha>        # recover (reflog keeps ~30 days)
```

Document recovery with `Risk: high` + `Why:` trailers. Create backup branch before any destructive recovery: `git branch backup-before-recovery`
