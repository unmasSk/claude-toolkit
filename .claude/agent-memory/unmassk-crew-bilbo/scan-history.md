## 2026-03-14 — marketingskills ref-repo survey

Mapped 27 non-SEO skills from `.ref-repos/marketingskills/skills/`.
Produced word-count table + proposed reference grouping into 10 thematic groups for the marketing plugin.
No orphan or dead-code findings — this was an inventory scan, not a dependency trace.
No escalation needed.

## 2026-03-14 — unmassk-design plugin source survey (5 repos)

Surveyed 5 design ref-repos for unmassk-design plugin consolidation:
- **Impeccable** (~10,400 words): frontend-design SKILL.md + 7 reference files + 5 command skills. Best-in-class anti-AI-slop philosophy. 17 command skills total (audit, critique, polish, bolder, animate, etc.). No scripts/data.
- **UI/UX Pro Max** (~6,500 words SKILL.md alone): searchable CSV database (products, styles, colors, typography, ux-guidelines, charts, google-fonts, react-performance, etc.) + 3 Python scripts (search.py, core.py, design_system.py). Separate design/brand/banner-design/ui-styling/design-system skills each have their own scripts and CSVs. The only source with a working search engine.
- **bencium-controlled-ux-designer** (~10,500 words across 5 files): Deep accessible-code patterns (ARIA, shadcn/Tailwind, Phosphor icons). Unique: DESIGN-SYSTEM-TEMPLATE.md fixed/project-specific/adaptable framework. Heavy React/Tailwind specificity.
- **typography** (~3,800 words): Rooted in Butterick's Practical Typography. Unique: HTML entities table, OpenType features, JSX/React curly-quote implementation guide. CSS baseline template. Enforcement-mode design.
- **relationship-design** (~9,400 words across 4 files): Unique domain — agentic UX, memory architecture, trust evolution (3 stages), compounding value metrics. TypeScript implementation patterns. No overlap with any other source.

Key consolidation recommendation: Impeccable provides the design principles core; UI/UX Pro Max provides the data/search infrastructure; bencium provides deep accessibility + component patterns; typography provides typographic correctness layer; relationship-design is entirely orthogonal (agentic/AI UX only).

No orphans, no dead code — inventory scan only. No escalation needed.

## 2026-03-15 — unmassk-ops plugin integrity verification (all 5 skills)

Full cross-reference audit of `/unmassk-ops/skills/` against all 5 SKILL.md declarations.

**Result: ALL 5 SKILLS PASS — zero integrity failures.**

Counts confirmed:
- ops-iac: 20 scripts, 14 references — all declared, all physical, all match
- ops-containers: 22 scripts, 19 references — all declared, all physical, all match
- ops-cicd: 29 scripts (+jenkins-lib/__init__.py as undeclared but expected), 30 references — all match
- ops-observability: 10 scripts, 9 references — all declared, all physical, all match
- ops-scripting: 11 scripts, 21 references — all declared, all physical, all match

Syntax checks: all .py files compile (python3 -m py_compile), all .sh files pass (bash -n). Zero failures.
Path checks: all SKILL.md code blocks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` — no absolute or relative paths.

Minor observations (not failures):
- `__pycache__/` dirs present in 4 skills (ops-cicd, ops-containers, ops-iac, ops-observability) — build artifacts committed to repo, not referenced in SKILL.md (expected, not a defect)
- `jenkins-lib/__init__.py` exists physically in ops-cicd but not in SKILL.md script table — correct: it's a Python package init file, not a callable script
- ops-cicd SKILL.md description says "29 scripts" but table has 30 entries (2 jenkins-lib files) — minor count discrepancy in metadata, not a structural failure

No escalation needed.

## 2026-03-15 — unmassk-db plugin integrity verification (all 7 skills)

Full cross-reference audit of `/unmassk-db/skills/` against all 7 SKILL.md declarations.

**Result: 5 SKILLS PASS, 2 SKILLS FAIL.**

Counts confirmed:
- db-postgres: 22 references — all declared, all physical, all match. No scripts. PASS.
- db-mysql: 19 references — all declared, all physical, all match. No scripts. PASS.
- db-mongodb: 10 references — all declared, all physical, all match. No scripts. PASS. (routing table uses bare filenames without references/ prefix — format difference only)
- db-redis: 35 physical files, 34 declared in routing table. `redis-overview.md` is on disk and counted in frontmatter ("35 reference files") but missing from routing table. FAIL — dead reference file.
- db-migrations: 4 references + 4 scripts — all declared, all physical, all match. PASS.
- db-vector-rag: 5 references — all declared, all physical, all match. No scripts. PASS.
- db-schema-design: 5 references + 2 scripts — all declared, all physical, all match. PASS.

Syntax checks: all 6 .py files compile (python3 -m py_compile). Zero failures.
Path checks: all SKILL.md script blocks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` — no absolute or relative paths.

Minor observations (not failures):
- `__pycache__/` dirs present in db-migrations and db-schema-design — build artifacts, not in SKILL.md (expected)

No escalation needed.

## 2026-03-15 — compliance-i18n skill content audit

Full read of all 10 reference files in `/unmassk-compliance/skills/compliance-i18n/references/`.

**Critical finding: SKILL.md is MISSING.** The directory contains only references, no frontmatter, no trigger declarations, no workflow. The skill cannot be invoked by any agent — it is structurally incomplete.

**Content reality: this is NOT a compliance skill. It is 100% localization tooling documentation for the "Better i18n" SaaS platform.** Zero regulatory, legal, or compliance content.

Reference files confirmed:
- `i18n-best-practices.md` — Master index/architecture overview + CDN URL structure + caching tables
- `getting-started.md` — Platform onboarding (account, project, i18n.config.ts, CLI scan, SDK install)
- `cli-usage.md` — CLI commands: scan, check/check:missing/check:unused, sync, push, pull + CI/CD + pre-commit hooks
- `key-management.md` — Key naming conventions, namespace patterns, translation status lifecycle, CRUD operations
- `ai-translation.md` — AI translation workflow, glossary management, ICU MessageFormat handling, batch translation, language-specific notes
- `github-sync.md` — GitHub App setup, AST-based key discovery, PR workflow, webhooks, conflict resolution
- `cdn-delivery.md` — Cloudflare CDN, URL structure, output formats (flat/nested/namespaced), caching headers, service worker
- `mcp-integration.md` — MCP server for Claude/Cursor: 10 tools (listProjects, getProject, getAllTranslations, listKeys, createKeys, updateKeys, deleteKeys, addLanguage, getPendingChanges, publishTranslations, getSyncs, getSync)
- `sdk-integration.md` — @better-i18n/next (Next.js/next-intl), @better-i18n/use-intl (React/Vite/TanStack Start), ICU MessageFormat, TypeScript support
- `best-practices.md` — ICU pluralization, gender/select, numbers/currency/dates, RTL, text expansion, accessibility, pseudo-localization testing

Scripts: NONE. No scripts in this skill.
Escalation: Ultron needs to create SKILL.md before this skill is usable.

## 2026-03-15 — Full toolkit capability map (all production plugins + agents)

Scanned all 47 production skills + 10 crew agents = 57 capability units across 11 plugins.

**Top 10 confirmed gaps** (nothing in toolkit covers these):
1. Backend framework skill (Node/Express/Fastify/Bun/Go — no framework patterns)
2. Authentication implementation skill (JWT, OAuth2/OIDC, sessions, RBAC — only audited, never built)
3. Frontend development skill (React/Next.js patterns, state management, forms, React Query)
4. API design skill (OpenAPI/Swagger, REST conventions, GraphQL, gRPC — entirely absent)
5. Payment integration skill (Stripe, subscriptions, webhooks — absent)
6. Email service skill (transactional email — Resend/Postmark/AWS SES + templating)
7. Serverless/PaaS deployment skill (Vercel, Railway, Fly.io, Cloudflare Workers — ops is K8s-only)
8. Application error tracking skill (Sentry, OpenTelemetry instrumentation — ops-observability is infra-only)
9. ORM/data access layer skill (Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM — db plugin covers engines, not access layer)
10. Product analytics/event tracking skill (PostHog, Mixpanel — marketing assumes events exist, no one creates them)

**Structural anomaly confirmed**: `compliance-i18n` is a localization tooling skill (Better i18n SaaS), misclassified in the compliance plugin. SKILL.md now exists (was missing in earlier scan, created since). Content mismatch remains — it's a dev tooling skill, not a compliance skill.

**Coverage summary by phase**:
- Database: best-covered (7 skills, all engines)
- Compliance: deepest EU/Spanish coverage (9 skills)
- Ops/DevOps: enterprise-grade K8s/IaC (5 skills) but misses PaaS/serverless
- Marketing/SEO: well-covered (2 aggregate skills, ~27+ marketing capabilities)
- Frontend: design only — no development patterns
- Backend: workflow/audit only — no framework patterns
- Auth: audit only — no implementation
- API: entirely absent

No escalation to Argus/Moriarty/Cerberus needed — inventory scan only.

## 2026-03-15 — OmawaMapas external project technology scan

Scanned `/Users/unmassk/Workspace/omawamapas/` — a geospatial SPA for asbestos inventory management.

**Confirmed tech stack:**
- Backend: Node.js 22+ / Express 5 / TypeScript ESM / Knex (query builder) / pg (direct driver)
- Frontend: React 19 / Vite / TypeScript / Radix UI Themes / Mapbox GL JS / Turf.js / Axios / react-router-dom 7
- Database: PostgreSQL 17 + PostGIS 3.3/3.4 via Supabase (cloud, session pooler — eu-west-1)
- Cache: Upstash Redis (cloud, TLS — ioredis client)
- Auth: Mock headers in dev (X-Mock-User-ID / X-Mock-User-Role), JWT in production
- API docs: Swagger/OpenAPI (swagger-jsdoc + swagger-ui-express)
- Testing: Vitest + Supertest + Testing Library
- Monitoring: Sentry (@sentry/node 9.x + profiling)
- Rate limiting: express-rate-limit / Helmet / compression / opossum (circuit breaker)
- Hosting target: Supabase (DB) + Upstash (Redis) + AWS EC2/RDS/ElastiCache for staging/prod

**Toolkit skill matches:**
- db-postgres: DIRECT match — PostgreSQL + PostGIS, connection pooling, migrations (Knex), query optimization
- db-redis: DIRECT match — Redis cache layer (Upstash via ioredis), TTL management, cache.service.ts
- db-migrations: DIRECT match — Knex migrations in `backend/src/db/migrations/`
- db-schema-design: RELEVANT — schema.sql exists at root, PostGIS spatial types
- compliance-owasp: RELEVANT — OWASP Top 10 explicitly in CLAUDE.md, SQL injection/XSS guards
- compliance-gdpr: POTENTIALLY relevant — user data, roles, municipio data
- ops-observability: PARTIAL match — Sentry present but ops-observability is infra-level (Prometheus/Grafana), not app-level
- ops-iac: RELEVANT for AWS staging — EC2 + RDS + ElastiCache + ALB architecture planned

**Confirmed gaps in toolkit for this project:**
- No Sentry/application error tracking skill (app-level vs infra-level)
- No Mapbox GL JS / geospatial frontend skill
- No Supabase skill (connection pooler specifics, RLS, auto-pause behavior)
- No Knex/ORM skill (db plugin covers engines, not query builders)
- No React 19 / Vite frontend dev skill

No orphans or dead code investigated — technology inventory scan only.

## 2026-03-14 — cc-devops-skills ref-repo full inventory

Surveyed all 31 skills in `.ref-repos/cc-devops-skills/devops-skills-plugin/skills/`.
- 103 total script files (Python + shell), 63 reference files, 31 docs files (94 combined support docs)
- 6 skills have NO scripts: ansible-generator, azure-pipelines-generator, gitlab-ci-generator, k8s-yaml-generator, promql-generator, terragrunt-generator
- 14 script names are duplicated across skills (confirmed DIFFERENT implementations — not copies, except detect_crd.py between k8s-yaml-validator and helm-validator which diverged significantly)
- Heaviest scripts: jenkinsfile-generator (~1,900 lines + 1,014 line lib/), loki-config-generator (~1,900 lines), fluentbit-generator (~1,835 lines), terraform-validator (~1,331 lines)
- 3 skills use __pycache__/.pyc artifacts committed to repo: k8s-yaml-validator, loki-config-generator, promql-validator, terraform-validator
- fluentbit-generator has a committed output/ dir with 2 generated config files — likely stale test artifacts
- Domain grouping: IaC (terraform, terragrunt, ansible, helm, k8s-yaml, k8s-debug — 7 skills), CI/CD (github-actions, gitlab-ci, azure-pipelines, jenkins, makefile — 9 skills), Containers/K8s (dockerfile, helm, k8s-yaml, k8s-debug — 4 skills), Observability (promql, logql, loki, fluentbit — 8 skills), Scripting (bash-script, makefile — 3 skills)
- No orphan SKILL.md files found — all 31 dirs have a SKILL.md
