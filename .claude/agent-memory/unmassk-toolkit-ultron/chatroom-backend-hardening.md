## Graceful shutdown pattern (2026-03-19)

`app.server?.stop()` closes all active Elysia WS connections with a close frame.
Sequence: `app.server?.stop()` → WAL checkpoint → `db.close()` → `process.exit(0)`.
Force-exit timer: `setTimeout(..., 5000).unref()` — `.unref()` prevents the timer from
keeping the process alive on its own; it only fires if the shutdown hangs.

```ts
process.on('SIGTERM', () => gracefulShutdown('SIGTERM'));
process.on('SIGINT',  () => gracefulShutdown('SIGINT'));
```

`getDb()` is imported from `db/connection.ts` to reach the singleton DB instance.

## onError hook placement (2026-03-19)

`.onError()` must be chained BEFORE `.use(apiRoutes)` and `.use(wsRoutes)` so it
catches errors from all downstream plugins. Shape: `{ error: string, code: string }`.
Never leak stack traces — only 'Not found' or 'Internal server error' as the message.

## Env validation in config.ts (2026-03-19)

Three helpers: `requireIntEnv(name, default, min, max)`, `requireEnumEnv(name, default, allowed[])`,
`stringEnv(name, default)`. All call `process.exit(1)` on invalid values after logging
a structured pino error. No new dependencies needed — built on `Number.isInteger` and
array `.includes()`.

`LOG_LEVEL` and `NODE_ENV` are validated as enums and exported from config.ts.
They cannot be imported back into logger.ts (circular dependency — logger.ts is imported
by config.ts). logger.ts must continue reading `process.env.LOG_LEVEL` directly.
This is intentional: config.ts exits on invalid values before any real work begins.

`WS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` validation: parse each comma-separated entry via `new URL(entry)`,
check `url.protocol === 'http:' || 'https:'`, exit(1) on bad format.

`AGENT_DIR` validation: when set via env, call `existsSync(dir)` — exit(1) if not found.
Auto-discovery fallback is unchanged.

`_isDev` in config.ts uses the validated `NODE_ENV` constant (not `process.env.NODE_ENV`).

## PORT default change

Original default was 3001. Changed to 3000 to match `.env.example` and spec.
Update `.env.example` and start scripts if the port needs to differ.

## Argus security fixes — session 4 (2026-03-19)

**SEC-OPEN-001** (index.ts): Swagger mounted conditionally — move `app.use(swagger(...))` out of
the chain into a post-construction `if (NODE_ENV === 'development' || NODE_ENV === 'test')` block,
matching the existing pattern for static plugin. Import `swagger` at top stays (tree-shaken in prod).

**SEC-OPEN-002** (api.ts): Rate-limit buckets split — `'auth-token'` for `/api/auth/token`,
`'invite'` for `/api/rooms/:id/invite`. Previously both shared `'global'`, letting one exhaust the other.

**SEC-OPEN-006** (agent-invoker.ts `sanitizePromptContent`): Two replacement lines prepended before
existing bracket patterns — strip U+FF3B, U+27E6, U+2E22, U+3010 → `(` and U+FF3D, U+27E7, U+2E23,
U+3011 → `)`. Must be first so homoglyphs cannot bypass subsequent bracket-pattern checks.

**SEC-OPEN-008** (ws.ts): `MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_ROOM = 20` const. In `open()`, after token
validation, check `roomConns.get(roomId)?.size >= MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_ROOM` — send error
`ROOM_FULL` + close. Uses `logger.warn` (structured) not `log` (unstructured).

**SEC-OPEN-010** (ws.ts): In the rate-limit `if` block in `message()`, add
`logger.warn({ connId, roomId }, 'WS rate limit exceeded')` before the error send.
Use `logger` (pino instance) not `log` (unstructured wrapper) to get structured fields.

**SEC-OPEN-011** (auth-tokens.ts): Upgraded to per-source tracking via `authFailureBySource: Map<string, FailureWindow>`.
Key = first 8 chars of token (enough to distinguish probing sources, avoids storing full tokens).
Missing/short tokens use sentinel key `'unknown'`. `recordAuthFailure(token?)` now takes the token as argument.
GC for stale windows added in the existing 10-min setInterval (removes entries older than 2x window).
Call sites updated: `peekToken` and `validateToken` pass `token` to `recordAuthFailure(token)`.

**SEC-BOOT-001** (logger.ts line 16): Changed from blacklist (`!== 'production'`) to allowlist
(`=== 'development' || === 'test'`). Bootstrap exception applies — logger reads process.env
directly here because config.ts is not yet loaded. Allowlist is still required to prevent
staging/misconfigured envs from getting pretty-printed dev logs.

## Config cleanup — session 5 (2026-03-19)

**Dead exports removed from config.ts**: `LOG_LEVEL`, `WS_ROOM_TOPIC_PREFIX`, `BANNED_TOOLS`.
- `LOG_LEVEL` — only consumer was logger.ts which reads `process.env` directly (circular dep prevents import).
- `WS_ROOM_TOPIC_PREFIX` — no runtime consumers; only appeared in config-validation.test.ts (test removed).
- `BANNED_TOOLS` — moved to single source of truth in agent-registry.ts (exported there, imported by agent-invoker.ts and tests).

**BANNED_TOOLS pattern**: `export const BANNED_TOOLS: readonly string[] = ['Bash', 'computer']` in agent-registry.ts.
Internal `const BANNED_TOOLS_SET = new Set(BANNED_TOOLS)` for O(1) lookup in buildRegistry().
agent-invoker.ts imports from `./agent-registry.js`, tests import from `./agent-registry.js`.
config-validation.test.ts: removed 4 dead-export tests (WS_ROOM_TOPIC_PREFIX x1, BANNED_TOOLS x3).

**AGENT_DIR canonicalization**: Added `realpathSync` import to config.ts. Applied in all 3 branches of
`resolveAgentDir()`: env var path, globSync match, and fallback (only if path exists — no error if fallback is virtual).

**logger.ts LOG_LEVEL validation**: Added inline enum check before pino initialization.
Pattern: `LOG_LEVEL_ALLOWED` const array, `_rawLogLevel` from env, early exit with `process.stderr.write()`
and `process.exit(1)` if invalid. Uses string concatenation (NOT template literals) in the
`process.stderr.write()` call — template literals in that position caused the TS compiler to
emit a literal newline inside the string when the linter converted `\n` to CRLF. String concat avoids this.

**auth-tokens.ts size cap**: `AUTH_FAILURE_MAX_ENTRIES = 5_000` const. In `recordAuthFailure`,
before adding a new entry (when `!window`), check size and evict the oldest Map key if at capacity.
Map insertion order is FIFO so `keys().next().value` gives the oldest entry.

**auth-tokens.ts constant-time lookup**: Added `tokenBuf: Buffer` field to `TokenEntry` interface.
`issueToken` stores `Buffer.from(token)` in the entry. `peekToken` and `validateToken` both:
1. Call `Map.get(token)` to find the entry.
2. Create `givenBuf = Buffer.from(token)`.
3. Check `entry.tokenBuf.length !== givenBuf.length` first (timingSafeEqual throws on length mismatch).
4. Call `crypto.timingSafeEqual(entry.tokenBuf, givenBuf)` — defense-in-depth after the Map lookup.

**Linter behavior**: A linter/formatter runs on every file write and reverts content using CRLF.
When writing TypeScript files with string literals containing `\n`, use Python binary writes with
hex bytes (`b'\x5c\x6e'`) or string concatenation instead of template literals to avoid CRLF normalization
corrupting escape sequences. The Edit tool triggers the linter; batch Python writes survive if done
atomically before the linter fires.

**SEC-OPEN-012** (agent-invoker.ts): Wrap `stderrOutput.trim()` in `sanitizePromptContent()`
before calling `log()`. The safeStderr variable replaces the raw trim inline.

## Session 7 fixes — 2026-03-19 (Bilbo findings)

### Shared rate-limiter factory (services/rate-limiter.ts)
`createTokenBucket(max, windowMs)` returns a `(key: string) => boolean` closure.
Each caller gets its own Map — no shared state between API and WS limiters.
`api.ts` and `ws.ts` both import from this module instead of duplicating the inline implementation.
`checkUpgradeRateLimit` in `ws.ts` uses an IIFE wrapping `createTokenBucket` with a constant `'global'` key.

### WS ingress sanitization
In `ws.ts` `send_message` handler, the `@mention` path now calls
`sanitizePromptContent(msg.content)` before passing content to `invokeAgents`.
The `@everyone` directive path was already sanitized — this closes the gap for direct @mention invocations.

### getReservedAgentNames() shared function
`auth-tokens.ts` exports `getReservedAgentNames(): Set<string>` — returns the WS-layer
name-blocking set (excludes 'user' and 'claude', includes 'system' and all AGENT_BY_NAME keys).
`ws.ts` imports it instead of duplicating the construction. The auth-token issuance set
(also in auth-tokens.ts) uses a slightly different filter (excludes 'user' only).

### auth-tokens.ts setInterval .unref()
`setInterval(...).unref()` added so the GC timer does not prevent process exit
after all real work completes.

### drainActiveInvocations() — graceful shutdown
`agent-invoker.ts` exports `drainActiveInvocations(): Promise<void>` — waits on all
`activeInvocations` Map values via `Promise.allSettled`. Resolves immediately when empty.
`index.ts` imports it and `await drainActiveInvocations()` between `app.server?.stop()` and
`db.exec('PRAGMA wal_checkpoint')`. `gracefulShutdown` is now `async`. Signal handlers use
`void gracefulShutdown(...)` to silence the floating promise.

### Swagger restricted to development only
`index.ts`: `if (NODE_ENV === 'development')` — removed `|| NODE_ENV === 'test'`.
Swagger adds HTTP overhead and leaks API surface in test mode.

### Dead code removal
- `logger.ts`: `export default rootLogger` → `export { rootLogger }` (named export).
  `logger.test.ts` updated to `import { createLogger, rootLogger } from './logger.js'`.
- `utils.ts`: `formatTimeHHMM` removed. `utils.test.ts` describe block removed.
- `stream-parser.ts`: `StreamEvent` type alias made module-private (was exported but unused externally).
  `PermissionDenial` interface was already private after previous session.
- `mention-parser.ts`: `log()` unstructured wrapper removed; replaced with `logger.debug(...)` calls.

### Test renames and additions
- `routes/invite.test.ts` renamed to `routes/api-invite.test.ts`.
- `routes/api.test.ts`: test server handler updated to strip `allowedTools` (matching production).
  Old "each agent has an allowedTools array" test replaced with
  "allowedTools is stripped from every agent in the production route (SEC-MED-001)".

## Session 8 fixes — 2026-03-19

### readStderr try/catch (agent-stream.ts)
The async IIFE inside `readStderr` is now wrapped in try/catch. On any thrown error
from the stderr stream, `logger.warn({ err: err.message }, 'stderr stream error')` is
called and `result.stderrOutput` is set to `''`. This prevents an unhandled rejection
from propagating to the process-level rejection handler when the subprocess stderr stream
fails unexpectedly.

### BunSpawnOptionsWithDetached interface (agent-runner.ts)
Replaced `as any` cast on `Bun.spawn` with a typed interface:
```ts
interface BunSpawnOptionsWithDetached extends Bun.SpawnOptions.Readable {
  detached?: boolean;
}
```
`spawnOpts` is declared as `BunSpawnOptionsWithDetached`, then passed to `Bun.spawn`.
The `as any` cast comment was removed along with the cast itself.
