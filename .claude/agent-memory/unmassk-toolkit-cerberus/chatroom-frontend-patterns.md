## Intentional Patterns (do NOT flag)

- `StrictMode WebSocket protection` — ws-store.ts uses connectingRoomId guard + AbortController. The old 2s debounce was removed (incompatible with StrictMode). Do not flag as "unnecessary complexity".
- `circuit breaker in ws-store` — `consecutiveAuthFailures` counter, resets ONLY on `room_state` message (not onopen — phantom Vite proxy opens are not proof of backend availability). `AbortSignal.any([signal, AbortSignal.timeout(5000)])` on auth fetch is intentional and correct. Do not flag as over-engineering.
- `reconnectAttempts` not reset in `onopen` — intentional: phantom proxy onopen fires before backend is ready. Only `room_state` resets it. Do not flag.
- `timeout: 5000` + `proxyTimeout: 5000` on Vite proxy `/ws` entry — known open concern: any quiet WS connection >5s gets dropped. Monitor if spurious disconnects appear.
- `memo()` on MessageLine, MessageList, ParticipantItem, ToolLine, SystemMessage, QueueGroup — correct. ChatArea, App, Titlebar, StatusBar deliberately NOT memoized (structural, cheap). Do not suggest memoizing them.
- `seenIds` module-level Set in chat-store.ts — intentional dedup guard for StrictMode double-mount WS duplicate messages. Not a singleton anti-pattern.
- `as CSSProperties` in agentCardStyle() — needed for CSS custom property injection (`--ac`, `--agent-tint`). Not a type escape.
- `useCallback` on handleChange, submit, handleKeyDownWrapper, handleSelectAgent in MessageInput — justified: these are passed as props to child components and memoized children depend on reference stability.
- Traffic light hex colors in Titlebar.css (#FF5F57, #FFBD2E, #28C840) — intentional macOS system colors, not from design token system.
- `e.preventDefault()` on mousedown in MentionDropdown — intentional to fire before textarea blur closes dropdown.

## Known Open Violations — updated 2026-03-21 (after CSS fix batch)

### T2 (blocking)
- globals.css: 736 LOC — still over 800 limit? No — 736 < 800, T2 CLOSED. Monitoring: keep under 800.
- AGENT_COLOR Record in ParticipantItem.tsx duplicates --color-<agent> CSS variable system — DRY violation (still open)
- `as unknown as React.KeyboardEvent<HTMLInputElement>` in MessageInput.tsx — RESOLVED (cast removed, comment added at line 59)
- Zero frontend tests — PARTIALLY RESOLVED: ws-store.test.ts added (81 tests pass). Full RTL component tests still missing.

### T3 (non-blocking)
- TopBar.tsx — dead export, never imported (still open)
- AGENT_COLOR_VAR in colors.ts — exported but never used; also references undefined --agent-* CSS vars (still open)
- Old sidebar CSS in globals.css: .panel, .participant, .status-indicator etc. — dead, replaced by Sidebar.css (still open)
- Legacy .msg-content CSS blocks in globals.css — dead, components use .msg-text (still open)
- Hardcoded hex colors in AgentCard.css (#3d3d3d, #555555, #1a1a1a etc.) and ChatInput.css — still open
- MentionDropdown: missing ARIA combobox pattern (no role=listbox, no aria-expanded on textarea) (still open)
- ParticipantItem action buttons: no :focus-within CSS to reveal buttons on keyboard focus (still open)
- `mode` state in MessageInput never sent in WS payload — YAGNI (still open — send-btn color changes work, but mode is UI-only)
- `_detail` param in agent-store updateStatus accepted but ignored — remove from interface (still open)

### RESOLVED in 2026-03-21 CSS fix batch
- globals.css LOC: 962 → 736 (T2 CLOSED — under 800 limit)
- Duplicate CSS: .scroll-bottom and .send-btn removed from globals.css — confirmed absent (T2 CLOSED)
- --color-claude token added to tokens.css (T3 CLOSED)
- .card-wrap.agent-claude added to AgentCard.css — all 11 agents now have CSS accent classes (T3 CLOSED)
- 6 Claude CSS classes in globals.css now reference var(--color-claude) (T3 CLOSED)
- position:relative on .chat-input — scroll-bottom button can now anchor correctly (T3 CLOSED)
- MessageInput.tsx: send-btn receives .send-brainstorm class on brainstorm mode — color changes wired (T3 CLOSED)

## Scoring Baseline — 2026-03-21 (after CSS fix batch)

Score: 70/110 (+2 from 68)
- Security: 9/9 (full marks — unchanged)
- Error Handling: 6/9 (unchanged)
- Structure: 8/8 (+2: globals.css LOC resolved, duplicate CSS resolved)
- Testing: 0/8 (no test suite — unchanged)
- Maintainability: 3/5 (unchanged — AGENT_COLOR DRY violation still open)

**Why:** Structure dimension now full marks. Testing remains the biggest drag.
**How to apply:** On re-audit after test suite is added, re-score Testing from 0. After AGENT_COLOR DRY fix, +1 Maintainability.

## WS Reconnect Fix — Round 1 Issues (RESOLVED in Round 2)

- T2: `offline` status has no escape path — RESOLVED: retryOffline() + visibilitychange + sb-retry-btn added
- T2: Two offline-setting paths inconsistent — RESOLVED: both paths now set `roomId: null`
- T3: Misleading comment — RESOLVED: comment now correctly describes behavior

## Intentional Patterns from WS Reconnect Fix (Round 2 — do NOT flag)

- `timeout: 30000, proxyTimeout: 5000` on Vite proxy `/ws` entry — intentional: `timeout` is the handshake timeout, `proxyTimeout` is the per-message timeout. Asymmetry is correct design.
- `lastKnownRoomId` not cleared after recovery — intentional: harmless stale module var; retryOffline() guard (`if (!lastKnownRoomId) return`) prevents double-fire. Not a memory leak.
- `document` guard on visibility listener — correct SSR/test guard. Do not flag.
- Module-level visibility listener never removed — intentional: ws-store is a singleton module, never unmounted.
- `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_AUTH_FAILURES = 3` (down from 5) — intentional threshold change, not a magic number.

## Open Issues — WS Reconnect Fix Round 2

### T1 (blocking — bug)
- `fetch('/api/health', ...)` in ws-store.ts:58 — WRONG PATH. Backend health endpoint is at `/health` (root, not under `/api` prefix). Vite proxy maps `/api/*` → backend `/api/*`. Request will get 404, health check never recovers.

### T3 (non-blocking)
- `lastKnownRoomId` never reset to `null` after successful recovery — stale after reconnect but harmless (guarded by status check in retryOffline). Low priority.
- `sb-retry-btn` has no `aria-label` — button text "Retry" is sufficient for screen readers but adding `aria-label="Retry WebSocket connection"` would be more explicit.
- `SIDEBAR_ORDER` in ParticipantPanel.tsx is a module-level constant with 10 hardcoded agent names — claude is missing from the list (agents falling outside the list sort to end). Not a bug but worth noting.
