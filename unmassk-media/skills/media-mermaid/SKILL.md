# Mermaid Diagram Creator

Generate `.mmd` files (or fenced ` ```mermaid ` blocks in `.md` files when embedding in docs).

## Reference Files (load as needed)

| File | Load when... |
|------|-------------|
| `references/types/<type>.md` | After choosing diagram type (Step 6). Full syntax, examples, layout tips, line-break rules, and pitfalls for that type. |
| `references/syntax-pitfalls.md` | Render fails or you need to debug syntax. Covers quoting rules, `<br>` compatibility matrix (Section 9), reserved words, and common errors. |
| `references/mermaid-theme.md` | **The single theming file.** Dark/light mode color guidelines, `classDef` semantic style recipes (trigger, success, error, ai, decision), and per-diagram-type support notes. |
| `references/render_mermaid.sh` | The render script. Invoked via bash, not read. See Render & Validate below. |
| `references/examples/` | Validated `.mmd` examples (`architecture.mmd`, `sequence-api.mmd`). Review for inspiration or to verify your syntax against known-good patterns. |

## Customization

To customize brand styles, edit `references/mermaid-theme.md` — this is the single source of truth for all theming (semantic node styles and dark/light mode color guidelines).

## Core Philosophy

**Diagrams should ARGUE, not DISPLAY.**

A diagram isn't formatted text. It's a visual argument that shows relationships, causality, and flow that words alone can't express. The shape should BE the meaning.

**The Isomorphism Test**: If you removed all text, would the structure alone communicate the concept? If not, redesign.

**The Education Test**: Could someone learn something concrete from this diagram, or does it just label boxes? A good diagram teaches—it shows actual formats, real event names, concrete examples.

| Bad (Displaying) | Good (Arguing) |
|------------------|----------------|
| 5 equal boxes with labels | Each concept has a shape that mirrors its behavior |
| Card grid layout | Visual structure matches conceptual structure |
| Icons decorating text | Shapes that ARE the meaning |
| Same container for everything | Distinct visual vocabulary per concept |

---

## Design Process

### Step 0: Assess Depth and Audience

Before anything else, determine what level of detail this diagram needs:

- **Simple/Conceptual**: Abstract shapes, labels, relationships. Use when explaining a mental model, the audience already knows the details, or the concept IS the abstraction.
- **Comprehensive/Technical**: Concrete examples, code snippets, real data. Use when diagramming a real system, creating educational content, or showing how technologies integrate.

| Simple Diagram | Comprehensive Diagram |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Generic labels: "Input" → "Process" → "Output" | Shows what the input/output actually looks like |
| Named boxes: "API", "Database", "Client" | Named boxes + real requests/responses |
| "Events" or "Messages" label | Real event/message names from the spec |
| ~30 seconds to explain | ~2-3 minutes of teaching content |
| Viewer learns the structure | Viewer learns the structure AND the details |

Match density to audience:

| Audience | Node Count | Detail Level |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Executive / overview | 5–7 | High-level boxes, no attributes |
| Technical documentation | 10–15 | Subgraphs, edge labels, evidence artifacts |
| Deep reference | 15–20, then split | Full attributes, Notes, companion files |

When the same system needs multiple audiences, create separate diagrams — not one diagram that tries to serve everyone.

### Step 1: Research (Comprehensive diagrams only)

**Before drawing anything technical, research the actual specifications.**

If you're diagramming a protocol, API, or framework:
1. Look up the actual JSON/data formats
2. Find the real event names, method names, or API endpoints
3. Understand how the pieces actually connect
4. Use real terminology, not generic placeholders

Bad: "Protocol" → "Frontend"
Good: "AG-UI streams events (RUN_STARTED, STATE_DELTA, A2UI_UPDATE)" → "CopilotKit renders via createA2UIMessageRenderer()"

### Step 2: Understand Deeply
Read the content. For each concept, ask:
- What does this concept **DO**? (not what IS it)
- What relationships exist between concepts?
- What's the core transformation or flow?
- **What would someone need to SEE to understand this?** (not just read about)

### Step 3: Map Concepts to Patterns
For each concept, find the visual pattern that mirrors its behavior:

| If the concept... | Use this pattern |
|-------------------|------------------|
| Spawns multiple outputs | **Fan-out** (single node, multiple outgoing edges) |
| Combines inputs into one | **Convergence** (multiple nodes into one target) |
| Has hierarchy/nesting | **Tree** (mindmap or subgraph nesting) |
| Is a sequence of steps | **Timeline** (timeline diagram or sequence diagram) |
| Loops or improves continuously | **Spiral/Cycle** (state self-transitions or back-edges) |
| Transforms input to output | **Assembly line** (flowchart pipeline) |
| Compares two things | **Side-by-side** (parallel subgraphs) |
| Separates into phases | **Gap/Break** (subgraph boundaries) |

### Step 4: Ensure Variety
For multi-concept diagrams: **each major concept must use a different visual pattern**. No uniform cards or grids.

### Step 5: Sketch the Flow
Before writing syntax, mentally trace how the eye moves through the diagram. There should be a clear visual story.

### Step 6: Generate Mermaid Syntax
1. Choose diagram type using the Decision Matrix below, then load `references/types/<chosen-type>.md` for full syntax.
2. Write the syntax — start with a `%%` comment block naming the diagram type and describing each section.
3. Use meaningful node IDs (not `A`, `B`, `C` — use `authService`, `dbWrite`, `userInput`).
4. Add `classDef` for semantic styling (trigger, success, error, ai, decision) — pull from `references/mermaid-theme.md` (Section 2). Follow the color selection guidelines in Section 1 to ensure dark/light mode compatibility.
5. **Output format**: Create a `.mmd` file by default. Use a fenced ` ```mermaid ` block when the user says "embed", "add to docs", "in README", or the target is a `.md` file.

#### Evidence Artifacts (Comprehensive diagrams)

Include concrete examples that prove accuracy and help viewers learn:
- **Notes** (sequence diagrams) for data payloads and message formats.
- **Multi-line node labels** using `<br>` for concise inline evidence.
- **Subgraph titles** to label regions.
- **Companion .md files** for large payloads or code snippets that won't fit in node text.

The key principle: **show what things actually look like**, not just what they're called.

#### Multi-Zoom (Comprehensive diagrams)

Aim for three zoom levels simultaneously:
1. **Summary Flow** — simplified overview of the full pipeline (`Input → Processing → Output`)
2. **Section Boundaries** — labeled subgraphs grouping related components (by responsibility, phase, or team)
3. **Detail Inside Sections** — evidence artifacts and concrete examples within each section

#### Splitting Large Diagrams

- Keep nodes to ~20 max before splitting into multiple diagrams.
- For complex systems: one `.mmd` per layer (Context → Container → Component).
- Break dense subgraphs into separate files with cross-references in prose.

### Step 7: Render & Validate
Run the render script and validate the output. See the **Render & Validate** section below.

## Diagram Type Decision Matrix

Quick lookup: match the visual pattern you need to the best diagram type, then open its reference file.

| Visual Pattern | Best Diagram Type | Reference |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Fan-out (one-to-many) | Flowchart | `references/types/flowchart.md` |
| Convergence (many-to-one) | Flowchart | `references/types/flowchart.md` |
| Sequence of steps / interactions | Sequence Diagram | `references/types/sequence.md` |
| Hierarchy / tree | Mindmap | `references/types/mindmap.md` |
| State machine / lifecycle | State Diagram | `references/types/state.md` |
| Object structure / relationships | Class Diagram | `references/types/class.md` |
| System architecture / context | C4 Diagram | `references/types/c4.md` |
| Timeline / ordered events | Timeline Diagram | `references/types/timeline.md` |
| Spiral/Cycle (loop) | State Diagram or Flowchart | `references/types/state.md` `references/types/flowchart.md` |
| Side-by-side comparison | Flowchart (parallel subgraphs) | `references/types/flowchart.md` |
| Data schema / entity relationships | ER Diagram | `references/types/er-diagram.md` |
| Flow volumes / resource allocation | Sankey Diagram | `references/types/sankey.md` |

### Excluded Diagram Types

Do **not** use these types — they lack structural argument capability or are too narrowly specialized:

| Type | Reason Excluded |
|------|-----------------|
| Pie Chart | Simple percentages; lacks structural argument capability |
| Gantt | Specifically for project scheduling, not conceptual mapping |
| Git Graph | Limited to git branch visualization |
| XY Chart | Quantitative data charting rather than structural diagramming |
| User Journey | Overly specific; typically better represented as a Sequence Diagram |

## Render & Validate (MANDATORY)

**How to render:**
```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/media-mermaid/references/render_mermaid.sh <path.mmd> [output.png]
```
First run downloads mmdc via npx — may take ~30s.

**The loop:**
1. Write Mermaid syntax.
2. Run render script.
3a. If mmdc fails with a syntax error: read the error message, fix the syntax. Consult `references/syntax-pitfalls.md` for the most common failures (usually: unquoted special chars, wrong keyword, missing `end`).
3b. If mmdc succeeds: view the PNG, assess the layout.
4. If layout is poor: restructure — reorder node/edge declarations to change placement, switch `rankDir` (TD ↔ LR), add or remove subgraphs.
5. Re-render → repeat until the layout communicates the concept cleanly.

**Label quoting rule**: Always use `["label text"]` instead of `[label text]` whenever the label contains parentheses, commas, `@`, `/`, `<`, `>`, or `:`. When in doubt, quote it — `["My label"]` is always safer than `[My label]`. This single rule prevents ~50% of render failures. See `references/syntax-pitfalls.md` for the full list.

**`flowchart` not `graph`**: Always use `flowchart TD` (modern), never `graph TD` (legacy). `graph` lacks subgraph direction support and other modern features.

**`end` is reserved**: A node whose entire label is `end` will be parsed as a block terminator. Always quote it: `B["end"]`.

**You cannot pixel-position elements.** All layout improvements come from declaration order, `rankDir`, subgraphs, and hidden lines — not coordinate adjustments.

**Line crossing reduction** — the primary visual quality challenge in auto-generated diagrams:
- **Declaration order matters**: The layout engine assigns ranks based on source order. Declare nodes in reading order (top→bottom or left→right). Earlier declarations get higher or leftmost ranks.
- **Minimize back-edges**: Every edge flowing "backwards" to an earlier node forces a crossing. For cycles, use State diagrams or isolate the back-edge in a subgraph.
- **Group related nodes in source**: Keep nodes in the same logical group adjacent in code. Scattered declarations → scattered placement → crossings.
- **Subgraphs as layout hints**: Wrapping related nodes in a `subgraph` constrains placement, preventing global crossings. Each subgraph can define its own `direction` (e.g., `direction LR`) to resolve density issues.
- **Reduce fan-out**: A single node with 5+ outgoing edges creates spider-web layouts. Insert a dispatcher/group node to flatten.
- **Switch orientation**: When crossings persist, try the orthogonal `rankDir` (`TD` ↔ `LR`). This alone often eliminates most crossings.
- **Hidden lines**: Consider whether invisible edges would help constrain node placement.

**When to stop**: syntax valid, layout communicates the concept, line crossings minimized, no overlapping labels, eye flows correctly through the diagram.

## Quality Checklist

**Concept & Depth (check first for technical diagrams):**
1. Research done: looked up actual specs, formats, event names?
2. Evidence artifacts: Notes, multi-line node labels, companion `.md` for large payloads?
3. Multi-zoom: summary flow + section subgraphs + detail labels?
4. Concrete over abstract: real API names, real event names, not generic "Process"?
5. Educational value: could someone learn from this diagram?

**Diagram Design:**
6. Isomorphism Test: does visual structure mirror the concept's behavior?
7. Argument: does the diagram SHOW something text alone couldn't?
8. Variety: does each major concept use a different visual pattern or node shape?
9. Diagram type chosen intentionally (matches the concept's pattern from decision matrix)?
10. Node IDs are readable, not single letters?

**Mermaid-Specific:**
11. `classDef` used for semantic styling (trigger, success, error, ai, decision)?
12. Every `classDef` sets `fill`, `stroke`, AND `color`? (never omit `color` — see `references/mermaid-theme.md` Section 1 for dark/light mode guidelines)
13. Output format correct (`.mmd` vs fenced block)?
14. No excluded diagram types used? (Excluded: Pie Chart, Gantt, Git Graph, XY Chart, User Journey — see Decision Matrix above)
15. Node/edge declaration order follows reading direction (minimize line crossings)?
16. No single node has 5+ edges without a dispatcher split?
17. Back-edges isolated (cycles handled in State diagram or contained subgraph)?

**Render Validation (mandatory):**
18. Syntax validated: mmdc runs without error?
19. PNG viewed: layout visually inspected?
20. No overlapping labels or crossed text?
21. Eye flows naturally through the diagram?
22. Line crossings minimized (tried reordering + rankDir if needed)?

**Cleanup**
Once a user is happy with the output, remove any temporary output like pngs or mmd files.
