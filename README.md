## Quick start

**Step 1:** Add the repository as a marketplace source:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/unmasSk/claude-toolkit
```

**Step 2:** Install plugins from the interactive menu:

```
/plugin
```

Select any plugin from the list. Choose your scope:
- **User** (default): for yourself across all projects
- **Project**: for all collaborators on this repository (saved in `.claude/settings.json`)
- **Local**: for yourself in this repo only

> **Important:** `/plugin install` does NOT accept URLs. You must add the marketplace first, then install by name from the interactive menu.

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Git
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) v1.0.33+ (plugin support)

## unmassk-gitmemory

**Persistent memory for Claude Code, stored in git.**

Every time Claude starts a new session, it forgets everything. unmassk-gitmemory fixes this. After installing, Claude remembers decisions, preferences, blockers, and pending work across sessions, machines, and context resets. You don't need to do anything special -- just talk to Claude like you always do.

**How it works:** Every commit carries structured metadata (called "trailers") that Claude reads automatically when a session starts. No external files, no databases, no cloud services.

### Key features

- **Conversational capture** -- Say "let's go with X" and Claude saves the decision. Say "never use Y" and Claude saves the preference. No syntax to learn.
- **6 automatic hooks** -- Pre-commit validation, post-commit safety net, session boot, message radar, session exit, and context compression survival.
- **Hierarchical scopes** -- Commits are organized by scope (`backend/api`, `frontend/ux`) so Claude always knows the structure of your project.
- **Context awareness** -- Monitors Claude's context window and warns before auto-compaction, with debounced severity levels.
- **Garbage collector** -- Cleans stale `Next:` and `Blocker:` items using keyword overlap, TTL expiry, and explicit resolution heuristics. Never deletes commits -- uses tombstone trailers.
- **3 runtime modes** -- Normal (full trailers), Compatible (git notes for commitlint), Read-only (no write permissions).
- **3 skills** -- Core memory, lifecycle management (install/repair/uninstall), and issues/milestones.

### What gets remembered

| Type | Example | Auto-captured? |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Decisions | "use dayjs over moment" | Yes -- from conversation |
| Memos | preferences, requirements, anti-patterns, stack choices | Yes -- from conversation |
| Remembers | personality and working-style notes | Yes -- from conversation |
| Context bookmarks | where you left off, what's next | Yes -- on session end |
| Code commits | feat, fix, refactor with Why/Touched/Issue trailers | Yes -- on every commit |

### Dependencies

None. This is the foundational plugin.

## unmassk-crew

**10 specialized agents for software engineering.**

A collection of subagents, each with a distinct role and expertise. Claude delegates tasks to the right agent automatically based on context -- or you can invoke them directly through workflows like Flow and Audit.

### The agents

| Agent | Role | Specialty |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Bilbo** | Explorer | Deep codebase exploration, dependency mapping, structural analysis |
| **Ultron** | Implementer | Production code changes, pattern-consistent execution, test-backed delivery |
| **Dante** | Tester | Test creation, coverage expansion, regression and adversarial tests |
| **Cerberus** | Reviewer | Code review for correctness, maintainability, performance, quality |
| **Argus** | Security analyst | Vulnerability analysis, auth flaws, injection risks, secrets handling |
| **Moriarty** | Adversarial | Actively tries to break code -- proves failure modes before release |
| **House** | Diagnostician | Root cause analysis for bugs, test failures, and unexpected behavior |
| **Yoda** | Senior verdict | Final production-readiness judgment with weighted scoring |
| **Alexandria** | Documenter | CLAUDE.md maintenance, changelog updates, staleness detection |
| **Gitto** | Memory oracle | Read-only queries against git-memory history (decisions, memos, blockers) |

### Dependencies

None. Works standalone or with Flow and Audit.

## unmassk-flow

**8-step creative pipeline -- from idea to shipped code.**

A structured workflow for building features, fixes, and refactors. Combines brainstorming, TDD-based planning, and evidence-first agent execution. All decisions persist in git-memory. The plan file is the single source of truth.

### The pipeline

| Step | Name | Agent | What happens |
|------|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | Triage | Orchestrator | Classify as Quick / Standard / Big |
| 1 | Brainstorm | Orchestrator + User | Identify and resolve gray areas |
| 2 | Research | Bilbo | Investigate implementation approaches |
| 3 | Plan | Orchestrator | Write the plan file with tasks and waves |
| 4 | Execute | Ultron + Dante | Wave-based parallel implementation |
| 5 | Verify | Cerberus + conditionals | Quality gate (+ Argus, Moriarty, Yoda for Big features) |
| 6 | Document | Alexandria | Update CLAUDE.md and CHANGELOG |
| 7 | Close | Orchestrator | Merge, push, close issue, clean up |

### Dependencies

- **unmassk-crew** -- provides the agents
- **unmassk-gitmemory** -- persists decisions and context across steps

## unmassk-audit

**14-step enterprise audit for backend modules.**

A structured workflow for auditing backend modules against enterprise quality standards. Each step assigns a specific agent. The process produces a weighted score out of 110 and a final senior verdict.

### The workflow

| Step | Name | Agent |
|------|------|-------|
| 0 | Preparation | Orchestrator |
| 1 | Scan | Bilbo |
| 2 | Fix critical blockers | Ultron |
| 3 | Golden tests | Dante |
| 4 | Enterprise audit | Cerberus + Argus |
| 5 | Tier fixes | Ultron |
| 6 | Review fixes | Cerberus |
| 7 | Test fixed code | Dante |
| 8 | Adversarial validation | Moriarty |
| 9 | Adversarial tests | Dante |
| 10 | Re-audit | Cerberus |
| 11 | Senior review | Yoda |
| 12 | Documentation | Alexandria |
| 13 | Closure | Orchestrator |

Scoring dimensions: Security (x3), Error handling (x3), Structure (x2), Testing (x2), Maintainability (x1) = max 110 points.

### Dependencies

- **unmassk-crew** -- provides the agents

## How they work together

The plugins form a layered system:

```
Domain plugins (seo, marketing, design, ops, db, compliance) ──> unmassk-crew (agents execute domain work)
unmassk-audit ──> unmassk-crew
unmassk-flow ──> unmassk-crew + unmassk-gitmemory
```

- **gitmemory** is the foundation. Persistent memory regardless of which other plugins are installed.
- **crew** provides 10 agents. Works standalone or consumed by Flow, Audit, and all domain plugins.
- **flow** orchestrates agents through an 8-step pipeline, with decisions persisted by gitmemory.
- **audit** orchestrates agents through a 14-step audit workflow.
- **Domain plugins** (seo, marketing, design, ops, db, compliance) provide skills and references. Agents from crew execute the domain work.

### Recommended setups

| Use case | Install |
|----------|---------|
| Just persistent memory | gitmemory |
| Memory + agents | gitmemory + crew |
| Full development workflow | gitmemory + crew + flow |
| Full development + auditing | gitmemory + crew + flow + audit |
| Web project (frontend) | + seo + marketing + design |
| Web project (backend) | + ops + db |
| Everything | all 10 (media coming soon) |

## FAQ

**Q: Does this work with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket?**
A: Yes. All plugins work with any git host. Trailers are standard git metadata.

**Q: Does gitmemory work with commitlint or strict CI?**
A: Yes. It detects commitlint and switches to compatible mode (git notes instead of trailers).

**Q: Will this mess up my existing commits?**
A: No. The memory system only adds trailers to new commits. Existing history is never modified.

**Q: Does gitmemory put files in my project?**
A: Only `CLAUDE.md` (with a managed block) and `.claude/git-memory-manifest.json`. The plugin itself runs from the plugin cache.

**Q: Can I uninstall a plugin?**
A: Yes. Run `/plugin` in Claude Code and uninstall from the interactive menu.

**Q: Does gitmemory work with monorepos?**
A: Yes. It detects Turborepo, Nx, Lerna, pnpm workspaces, Rush, and Moon automatically.

**Q: What if Claude's context gets compressed?**
A: The Hippocampus hook extracts critical memory before compression and re-injects it.

**Q: How do I update plugins?**
A: Run `/plugin` in Claude Code, go to **marketplace**, and select **update**.

**Q: What if something breaks after updating?**
A: Delete `~/.claude/plugins/cache/unmassk-claude-toolkit/` and reinstall from the marketplace.
