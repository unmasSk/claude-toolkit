## The problem

Every time Claude starts a new session, it forgets everything:

- *Who decided to use dayjs instead of moment?*
- *What's the user's preference for arrow functions?*
- *What's blocking the deployment right now?*

You end up repeating yourself, re-explaining decisions, and watching Claude reinvent wheels.

**claude-git-memory fixes this.** After installing it, Claude remembers everything — across sessions, machines, and context resets. You don't need to do anything special. Just talk to Claude like you always do.

---

## How it works

**Git = Memory.** Every commit carries structured metadata (called "trailers") that Claude reads automatically when a session starts. No external files, no databases, no cloud services — everything lives in your git history.

Here's what a commit looks like with memory:

```
✨ feat(forms): add date range validation

Issue: CU-042
Why: users submit impossible date ranges crashing the report engine
Touched: src/forms/DateFilter.vue, tests/forms/dateFilter.test.ts
Decision: use dayjs over moment — moment is deprecated and 10x heavier
Next: wire validation into the API layer
```

**You don't write any of that.** Claude writes the trailers automatically from your conversation. When you say "let's go with dayjs", Claude creates a decision commit. When you say "never use sync fs", Claude creates a memo. You just talk.

### What Claude sees when it starts a new session

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Branch: feat/CU-042-filters                             │
│  Last session: "pause forms refactor" (2h ago)           │
│  Pending: wire validation into API layer                 │
│  Decision: (forms) use dayjs over moment                 │
│  Memo: (api) never use sync fs operations                │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

No questions. It knows where you left off.

---

## Quick start

### Install the plugin

Install `claude-git-memory` as a Claude Code plugin from the [marketplace](https://github.com/unmasSk/claude-git-memory), or add it directly to your project's `.claude/plugins.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["github:unmasSk/claude-git-memory"]
}
```

That's it. **No commands to run, nothing to configure.**

When Claude starts a session in your project, the plugin activates automatically:
1. Hooks register themselves (pre-commit, post-commit, session exit, context compression)
2. Skills load into Claude's context (memory rules, lifecycle, protocol, recovery)
3. Claude runs a silent health check and shows a memory summary

The hooks use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` to reference the plugin directory — you don't need to know where it lives or manage any paths.

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Git
- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) with plugin support

---

## You never run commands

This is the most important thing to understand:

**You never run CLI commands for the memory system. Claude handles everything.**

- Session start? Claude runs the health check and shows a memory resume.
- Need to search old decisions? Just ask: "what did we decide about auth?"
- Memory system broken? Claude detects and repairs it.
- Want to clean stale items? Say "clean up old blockers".
- Want a dashboard? Say "show me the dashboard".
- Want to uninstall? Say "remove git-memory".

The CLI commands exist, but they're for Claude to use internally — not for you. You just talk.

---

## What you say vs. what Claude does

You don't need to learn any syntax. Claude detects intent from natural language:

| You say | Claude does |
|---------|-------------|
| "let's go with X" | Creates a `decision()` commit |
| "always use X" / "never use Y" | Creates a `memo(preference)` |
| "the client requires X" | Creates a `memo(requirement)` |
| "don't ever do X again" | Creates a `memo(antipattern)` |
| "I need to stop here" / "pause" | Creates a `context()` bookmark with Next: |
| "what did we decide about X?" | Searches memory before asking you |

Claude always shows you the proposed commit message and waits for your "ok" before committing decisions, memos, and context bookmarks.

---

## What gets remembered

### Code commits (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `chore`, `ci`, `test`, `docs`)

Normal development work. Claude adds trailers automatically:

```
✨ feat(auth): add OAuth2 login flow

Why: users need to sign in with Google accounts
Touched: src/auth/oauth.ts, src/routes/login.ts
Issue: CU-101
```

Required trailers: `Why:` + `Touched:` (+ `Issue:` if the branch name has one)

### Context bookmarks — `context(scope)`

Created when you pause work or end a session:

```
💾 context(api): pause — switching to urgent bugfix

Why: need to handle prod incident before continuing API refactor
Next: finish rate limiting middleware after bugfix
```

Required: `Why:` + `Next:`

### Decisions — `decision(scope)`

Created when you make an architecture or design choice:

```
🧭 decision(auth): use JWT over session cookies

Why: API needs to be stateless for horizontal scaling
Decision: JWT with 15min access + 7d refresh tokens
```

Required: `Why:` + `Decision:`

### Memos — `memo(scope)`

Created when you state a preference, requirement, or antipattern:

```
📌 memo(api): preference — always use async/await over .then() chains

Memo: preference - async/await is more readable, team standard
```

Required: `Memo:` with category (`preference`, `requirement`, `antipattern`, or `stack`)

### WIP checkpoints

Temporary saves during work. Claude creates these automatically:

```
🚧 wip: half-done login form
```

No trailers required. Feature branches only. Squashed before merge.

---

## The four hooks

The memory system protects itself with four automatic hooks. You don't configure them — they activate on install.

| Hook | Nickname | When it runs | What it does |
|------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Pre-commit** | Belt | Before `git commit` | Blocks Claude's commits if trailers are missing. Human commits get a warning only — never blocked. |
| **Post-commit** | Suspenders | After `git commit` | Safety net. If a bad commit slips through and hasn't been pushed, rolls it back safely (`reset --soft`). Also regenerates the dashboard in the background. |
| **Session exit** | DoD | When Claude ends a session | If there are uncommitted changes, blocks exit and offers options: wip commit, context bookmark, stash, or discard. |
| **Context compression** | Hippocampus | Before Claude compresses context | Extracts a compact snapshot (branch, pending items, decisions, memos) and re-injects it so memory survives compression. |

### How Belt + Suspenders work together

**Belt** (pre-commit) catches problems before the commit happens. But some commit formats can't be parsed in advance (heredocs, `-F` flag). For those cases, **Suspenders** (post-commit) reads the actual commit after it lands and rolls it back if invalid.

- If HEAD hasn't been pushed → safe rollback with `reset --soft HEAD~1` (changes stay staged)
- If HEAD has been pushed → suggests a correction commit (never force-pushes)

### How Hippocampus works

When Claude's context window fills up, it compresses old messages. Before that happens, this hook extracts the most important memory from the last 30 commits:

- Branch name
- Last session bookmark
- Pending items (max 2)
- Blockers (max 2)
- Active decisions (max 3, one per scope)
- Active memos (max 2, one per scope)

This compact snapshot (~18 lines) gets re-injected into Claude's context, so it remembers what matters even after compression.

### GC tombstones

The hooks respect garbage collector tombstones. If an item has been cleaned by the GC (`Resolved-Next:`, `Stale-Blocker:`), hooks will skip it — no zombie items resurface.

---

## Automatic session boot

Every time Claude starts a session in your project, it automatically:

1. Runs a silent health check (doctor). If anything is broken, repairs it.
2. Reads the last 30 commits and extracts memory trailers.
3. Checks for uncommitted changes.
4. Shows you a compact summary:

```
=== BOOT — Memory Summary ===
Branch: feat/CU-042-filters
Last session: pause forms refactor (2h ago)
Pending: wire validation into API layer
Active decisions: (forms) use dayjs over moment
Active memos: (api) preference - never use sync fs operations
```

If there's nothing relevant, Claude just says: "Repo up to date. What are we working on?"

You don't ask for this. It happens automatically.

---

## Dashboard

A self-contained static HTML dashboard using the GitHub Primer dark theme. No server, no dependencies — just one file.

Say "show me the dashboard" and Claude generates it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="dashboard-screenshot.png" alt="git-memory dashboard" width="800">
</p>

**7 sections:** pending tasks, active blockers with age, decisions by scope, memos by category, compliance health (% of commits with proper trailers), GC status, and commit timeline.

**Auto-updates:** After every valid commit, the post-hook regenerates the dashboard in the background. The HTML auto-reloads every 10 seconds. Open it once and forget about it.

**State preserved:** Search queries, scroll position, and collapsed sections persist across reloads.

---

## Garbage collector

Stale `Next:` and `Blocker:` items accumulate over time. The GC cleans them using three heuristics:

| Heuristic | What it detects | How |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| **H1** — keyword overlap | `Next:` items already done | If newer commits in the same scope share 2+ keywords with the Next: text, it's likely resolved |
| **H2** — TTL expiry | `Blocker:` items gone stale | Blockers older than 30 days with no recent mention |
| **H3** — explicit resolution | Items resolved by a `Resolution:` trailer | Paired with `Conflict:` in merge conflict commits |

The GC **never deletes commits**. It creates a new commit with tombstone trailers (`Resolved-Next:`, `Stale-Blocker:`) that hide cleaned items from future snapshots and the dashboard. Fully reversible with `git revert`.

Say "clean up stale items" or "run gc" and Claude handles it.

---

## Trailer reference

Full list of trailers the system understands:

| Trailer | Format | Used in |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `Why:` | Free text | All commits (except `wip`) |
| `Touched:` | `path1, path2` or `glob/*` | Code commits |
| `Decision:` | Free text | `decision()` commits |
| `Memo:` | `category - description` | `memo()` commits |
| `Next:` | Free text | Pending work items |
| `Blocker:` | Free text | What blocks progress |
| `Issue:` | `CU-xxx` or `#xxx` | Auto-extracted from branch name |
| `Risk:` | `low` / `medium` / `high` | Dangerous operations |
| `Conflict:` | Free text | Merge conflict context |
| `Resolution:` | Free text | How a conflict was resolved |
| `Refs:` | URLs, doc links | External references |
| `Resolved-Next:` | (GC tombstone) | Marks a Next: as done |
| `Stale-Blocker:` | (GC tombstone) | Marks a Blocker: as stale |

**Rules:** case-sensitive keys, single-line values, contiguous block at the end of the commit body.

---

## Runtime modes

The plugin adapts to your project's constraints automatically:

| Mode | When | What happens |
|------|------|-------------|
| **Normal** | Standard git repo | Full system: hooks + trailers + CLI |
| **Compatible** | CI or commitlint rejects trailers | Uses git notes instead of commit trailers |
| **Read-only** | No write permissions | Reads existing memory, doesn't create commits |

If Claude detects a commitlint config or strict CI pipeline, it switches to compatible mode automatically. No action needed from you.

---

## Self-healing

Claude doesn't just install the system — it maintains it:

| Situation | What Claude does |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Hooks missing after a rebase | Detects on session start, re-registers |
| `.claude/` directory deleted | Reinstalls runtime from manifest |
| `settings.json` corrupted | Reconstructs hook registrations |
| Partial install (interrupted) | Completes missing pieces |
| After force push / history rewrite | Detects amnesia, rebuilds conservatively from current state, warns about gaps |

All of this happens automatically. Claude tells you what it fixed, but you don't need to do anything.

---

## Authority hierarchy

When there's a conflict between memory sources, Claude follows this priority:

1. **What you say in the conversation** (highest — always wins)
2. **Confirmed memory** (decisions and memos in commits)
3. **CLAUDE.md** of the project
4. **Code inferences** (lowest)

If Claude finds a contradiction (e.g., a new decision conflicts with an old memo), it warns you before creating the new commit.

---

## Branch and release workflow

- **Base branch:** `dev`. Work happens in `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`.
- **One issue = one branch.** Branch names like `feat/CU-042-filters` auto-extract the issue reference.
- **Default merge** (not rebase). Rebase only with explicit user request.
- **PR mandatory** for `dev → staging` and `staging → main`.
- **No `Next:` on main.** Main branch must be clean.
- **Force push to main: forbidden.** Always.
- **Hotfix flow:** branch from main → fix → PR to main → back-merge to dev.

---

## Undo safety

| Operation | Risk | Claude asks first? |
|-----------|------|--------------------|
| `reset --soft HEAD~1` | Low | No |
| `stash push/pop` | Low | No |
| `revert <sha>` | Low | No (creates new commit) |
| `amend` (before push) | Low | No |
| `amend` (after push) | **High** | Yes |
| `reset --hard` | **High** | Yes — shows what will be lost |
| `push --force-with-lease` | **High** | Yes — feature branches only |
| `push --force` main/staging | **Forbidden** | N/A |

---

## Memory policy

> "Write little, read often, confirm when it hurts to be wrong."

Claude only creates memory commits when:
- You asked explicitly
- It affects future sessions
- It prevents real loss
- It's a confirmed decision

Claude does **not** save:
- Provisional observations
- Weak inferences
- Session-only context that won't matter tomorrow

Before asking you something, Claude searches existing memory first:
1. Search decisions and memos in git log
2. Check CLAUDE.md
3. Only if no match: ask you

---

## CLI reference

The memory system has a full CLI. **Claude runs all of these automatically — you never need to type them.** They're documented here so you know what's happening under the hood.

### What you say → what Claude runs

| You say | Claude runs | What happens |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| *(start a session)* | `git memory boot` | Shows memory summary: branch, pending items, decisions, memos |
| "what did we decide about auth?" | `git memory search "auth"` | Searches all decisions, memos, and pending items |
| "show me all decisions" | `git memory decisions` | Lists every architecture decision in the project |
| "any pending work?" | `git memory pending` | Shows all unfinished Next: items |
| "what memos do we have?" | `git memory memos` | Lists all preferences, requirements, and antipatterns |
| "anything blocking us?" | `git memory blockers` | Shows all active blockers |
| "is the memory system healthy?" | `git memory doctor` | Full diagnostic: hooks, skills, CLI, manifest, GC status, version |
| "something's broken" | `git memory repair` | Reads the manifest, compares expected vs actual state, fixes gaps |
| "clean up old stuff" | `git memory gc` | Garbage collects stale Next/Blocker items with tombstones |
| "show me the dashboard" | `git memory dashboard` | Generates a static HTML dashboard and opens it |
| "scan this project" | `git memory bootstrap` | Scouts stack, frameworks, monorepo patterns, CI config |
| "install memory system" | `git memory install` | Transactional 5-phase installer: inspect → plan → apply → verify → health proof |
| "upgrade memory system" | `git memory upgrade` | Safe version migration with backup |
| "remove memory system" | `git memory uninstall` | Removes runtime, keeps git history intact |

All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output and `--auto` for non-interactive mode.

---

## Project scout (bootstrap)

On first contact with a repo, Claude can scan its structure without writing anything. It detects:

- **Languages:** JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Rust, Go, Java, Ruby, PHP, Elixir, .NET
- **Frameworks:** Next.js, React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Flask, Django, Rails, Laravel, and 40+ others
- **Monorepo tools:** Turborepo, Nx, Lerna, pnpm workspaces, Rush, Moon
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, CI pipelines, commitlint configs
- **Existing memory:** prior installations, trailers in history

Findings are classified as **facts** (high confidence) or **hypotheses** (needs confirmation). Claude shows results and asks before saving anything.

For monorepos, the scout builds a **scope map** — mapping directories like `apps/web` or `packages/ui` to scopes like `web` and `ui`. This helps Claude choose the right scope for commits automatically.

## FAQ

**Q: Does this work with GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket?**
A: Yes. Trailers are standard git metadata — they work with any git host.

**Q: Does this work with commitlint or strict CI?**
A: Yes. The plugin detects commitlint and switches to compatible mode (git notes instead of trailers).

**Q: Will this mess up my existing commits?**
A: No. The system only adds trailers to new commits. Existing history is never modified.

**Q: Can I uninstall it?**
A: Yes. Remove the plugin from your `.claude/plugins.json`. Commits with trailers stay intact forever — they're just normal git metadata.

**Q: Does it work with monorepos?**
A: Yes. The scout detects Turborepo, Nx, Lerna, pnpm workspaces, Rush, and Moon. It builds a scope map so Claude knows which package a commit belongs to.

**Q: What if Claude's context gets compressed?**
A: The Hippocampus hook extracts critical memory before compression and re-injects it. Decisions, memos, and pending items survive.

**Q: What if I rebase or force-push?**
A: Claude detects the amnesia on next session start, rebuilds memory from current state, and warns about any gaps.
