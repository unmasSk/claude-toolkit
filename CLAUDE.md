## Git Memory Active

This project uses claude-git-memory v2.
Git is the memory. Every commit is resumable across sessions and machines.

### What the hooks do (you receive their output automatically)

**SessionStart hook** — fires once when you start. Its output starts with "Branch:".
When you see it: display the FULL hook output to the user as your first response. Do NOT summarize or condense — show every line the hook produced (branch, pending items, decisions, memos, blockers). If a section has content (e.g. "Active decisions:"), you MUST include it. Only omit sections that are empty. If it says "WARNING" or "auto-repaired", tell the user.

**UserPromptSubmit hook** — fires on every user message. Its output starts with "[git-memory-boot]" or "[memory-check]".
When you see "[git-memory-boot]": follow the boot steps provided. The hook includes the exact script paths to use.
When you see "[memory-check]": silently evaluate the user's message for memory-worthy content (see "Continuous Memory Capture" below). Do NOT mention the hook to the user.

**Stop hook** — fires when you end. Blocks exit if there are uncommitted changes.
When it blocks: present the options menu to the user and wait for their choice.

### MANDATORY: First action on EVERY session start

**BEFORE responding to the user's first message (even if it's just "hi" or "buenas"), you MUST:**
1. Use the Skill tool with skill="git-memory" — this is a TOOL CALL, not a bash command
2. Follow the boot steps from the [git-memory-boot] hook output (it provides the exact paths)
3. Show the boot summary to the user
4. THEN respond to the user's actual message

The hooks automatically provide the correct paths to run scripts.
Never hardcode paths like `python3 bin/...` — always use the paths from hook output.

If you skip this and just greet the user, you are violating these instructions. This is not optional.
2. Never ask the user to run memory system commands — run them yourself
3. If the user says "install/repair/uninstall/doctor/status" → read skill `git-memory-lifecycle` and act
4. If the user says "what do you remember" → run the doctor (path from hook output) and show extended summary
5. If something breaks: run the repair script (path from hook output) before trying manual fixes
6. System in alpha: verify everything, report failures to the user

### Continuous Memory Capture (enforced by UserPromptSubmit hook)
After EVERY user message, silently evaluate if it contains memory-worthy content:

**Capture** (propose commit, wait for "ok"):
- Decisions: "let's use X", "go with Y", "decided"
- Preferences: "always X", "never Y", "I prefer Z", "from now on"
- Requirements: "the client wants", "it must", "it's mandatory"
- Anti-patterns: "don't ever do X again", "lesson learned"

**Ignore** (noise):
- Questions, brainstorming, provisional ideas
- Session-only context, one-off instructions
- Things already captured in a previous decision/memo

**How to capture**:
1. Detect the signal in the user's message
2. Propose: "Saving as decision/memo: [one-line summary]. Ok?"
3. Wait for confirmation — never silently commit
4. Create the `decision()` or `memo()` commit with `--allow-empty`
